the period of just about a month or so has been  manna from heaven on the parched earth of electoral reforms first the supreme court frowned upon freebies which it said shake the root of free and fair elections then came the verdict on section  of the representation of the people act  the act being ultra vires of the constitution and along with it the barring of jailed persons from electoral contest for its part the allahabad high court banned castebased rallies the staple of many a political party not to be left behind the central information commission added its mite by declaring that political parties came within the ambit of right to information act rti varied response the reactions have been varied to the striking down of section  of the act two prominent politicians one from the congress and the other from the bharatiya janata party both eminent lawyers were in agreement with the reasoning of the court some have questioned it for creating two categories of convicted legislators and some others on the competence of a twojudge bench overturning the  verdict of a fivejudge bench the reactions have been sharper over the part of the verdict on the jailed not being eligible to contest elections calling it judicial overreach rattled perhaps by the verdict that upon conviction a legislator loses his seat all kinds of objections have been raised it has been faulted for discriminating by creating two categories of legislators those who were convicted but appealed and so will continue as members and others who would hereafter immediately lose their seats the fact is lost sight of that this socalled discrimination is in fact a distinction the court made in the larger interest of preventing chaos and confusion that might arise if many legislators lost their membership suddenly another issue was that a legislator losing his membership upon conviction cannot get it back if acquitted on appeal those who raise it conveniently forget that a disqualified person who lost the chance to contest has no remedy either if acquitted in appeal soon thereafter these are inevitable as no law can be made to perfectly suit every situation as for the barring of jailed persons from electoral contest the verdict may perhaps not stand on further scrutiny while the law takes away the right to vote of a person in jail that it does not take away his eligibility to be registered as an elector seems to have escaped notice only those who are disqualified lose the eligibility to be electors may be the corrective will come in a  petition misplaced hype some have quoted legal experts to claim that a larger bench of the supreme court has already upheld in  the provision in section  and so the present judgment is erroneous they have also faulted it for failing to interpret the law bearing in mind the object of the provision for enactment which is to protect the house all this hype seems misplaced the simple fact is that before the constitution bench in  the question agitated was only the duration for which the protection afforded by section  would be valid not its vires and the court had clarified that it was available only till the term of that house and till the person continued to be a member if the political class is getting worried it is just as well because with growing number of legislators with criminal cases there is a real threat of this ruling creating problems but only if pending cases get decided the percentage of legislators with pending criminal cases is not less than  to  per cent in most houses and the number is not small uttar pradesh is said to have a whopping  per cent of criminally charged legislators according to some newspaper reports there is one legislator with as many as  cases pending  of them for murder another gentleman is an accused in  cases of murder out of  pending cases should we shed a tear if such distinguished people lose their membership because of the operation of this judgment strict and narrow construction in its  order the supreme court bench said in a slightly different context while a strict and narrow construction may not be adopted which may have the effect of shutting of many prominent and other eligible persons to contest elections but at the same time in dealing with a statutory provision which imposes disqualification on a citizen it would not be unreasonable to take merely a broad and general view in the current context i am sure public opinion will be overwhelmingly in favour of not a broad and general view but a strict and narrow construction to shut off such prominent persons from contesting elections or continuing as legislators but then from another angle the judgment declaring section  of the act as ultra vires of the constitution may merely seem all sound and fury signifying nothing given that the wheels of our criminal justice system grind slower than gods the chance that these tainted legislators will easily lose their eligibility to contest elections or to continue as legislators by being convicted seems a little farfetched being prominent they may successfully manage to slow the system even further so that they come to no harm that is the real danger interminable interlocutory proceedings or the compromising of witnesses and the  are not unknown weapons in the armoury of those who strive to slow down the judicial process if this verdict leads to political parties denying ticket to such distinguished people it would be a change for the good but if the past is any guide it does not inspire notwithstanding the sentiments expressed at the highest level by the two prominent national parties before the  parliament elections there was no substantial improvement when it came to ticket distribution in fact the number of mps with criminal record actually went up by  per cent for those with criminal cases and by  per cent for those with serious criminal charges in the th lok sabha as compared to the th so it is a moot point whether this verdict though welcome as it strikes a blow for cleaner legislators will lead to a substantial reduction in the number of tainted lawmakers a legislation to bar those charge sheeted for involvement at least in heinous crimes from contesting elections combined with fasttracking of such cases is the need of the hour if we are keen on the decriminalisation of legislatures and politics the verdict by itself is only a case of crossing half a well hollow argument a selfserving argument that such a special provision is needed to protect the house would ring hollow in this age and time political parties cannot escape responsibility when they merrily distribute ticket on the grounds of winnability to tainted candidates as though in a country of a billion people they could not find untainted people to contest elections seeking to save this provision by asking for a  moving a larger bench or through an alternative enactment will only mean conferring an advantage where it is least deserved namely on persons with criminal cases against them political parties should not in the first instance nominate such persons but should seek the fasttracking of such cases against their tainted members therein lies the remedy not in seeking a special provision institutional integrity is a phrase that has acquired much currency after the supreme court verdict in the cvc appointment case if appointing a tainted officer can compromise the integrity of an institution which is parliaments creation how can the presence of tainted legislators not compromise the institutional integrity of the parliament and assemblies the highest symbols of our democracy it is time political parties considered that the country the legislatures and the public deserve better

 ist delhi delhi assembly elections  delhi elections  sheila dikshit unauthorised colonies by pallavi polanki congress mla mukesh sharma has an enviable record as a politician at his office in uttam nagar a constituency in west delhi he has represented since  winning four elections in a row a mass of people are waiting their turn to meet him if anyone is in danger of being unseated because of an antiincumbency wave it should be sharma it is a predicament he shares with his government led by sheila dikshit which won its third consecutive victory in the  election and is bracing itself for the next round of assembly elections scheduled in november sitting behind a large desk in his office with people milling around him signing their documents with a speed and abandon that has endeared him to members of his constituency sharma says congress will win assembly  by comfortable majority comforted perhaps by an election arithmetic that has seen him through the last four elections there seems to be no question in his mind that this time too the numbers will stack up in favour of the congress party in true blue election spirit last years election manifesto has been dusted off and traditional votebanks are being rewarded for votes they cast four years ago representing one such crucial votebank for the congress are delhis teeming unauthorised colonies which predictably are seeing hectic government activity of late the carrot of authorisation of these colonies which means regular supply of electricity clean drinking water a sewage system bank loans against  sale and purchase of houses has worked  a charm in the past with voters work on in the recently regularised colonies in mohan garden uttam nagars largest unauthorised colony cluster naresh sharmafirstpost ahead of the last assembly election sheila dikshit had issued provisional regularisation certificates to  unauthorised colonies a move that did her and her party well with an eye on assembly  dikshit made good her promise by regularising over half of those colonies  in september last year a high value move given that population in the odd colonies is estimated at about  lakh number of electors in delhi is little over  crore of which  lakh voted in the last assembly election in more good news for residents of newly regularised colonies the dikshit government in may passed another order allowing sale and purchase of  in those colonies which have come up on private land by getting the ball rolling on regularisation dikshit has in effect handed congress candidates the winning mantra for their election campaign  sharma gives us a sample of what delhis residents will hear a lot of come campaign seasonwe have regularised  unauthorised colonies we have started development work in  of those colonies surveys are on since we have regularised so many they now trust us to regularise the remaining soon says sharma sharma has every reason to rejoice his constituency tops the number of unauthorised colonies that have been regularised in the west delhi district ask sharma how many unauthorised colonies have been regularised in uttam nagar he replies ask me how many havent with this trump card in hand the fourtime mla seems convinced that antiincumbency and the corruption scandals of his government will fade into the background of public memory uttam nagar is the first assembly constituency where all unauthorised colonies will have a sewage system within  months sewage work will be completed in all unauthorised colonies in mohan garden says sharma mohan garden is home to largest chunk of unauthorised colonies in uttam nagar with five months to go for elections residents of mohan gardens unauthorised colonies for the first time in the decades they have lived there are seeing the beginning of a sewage system being laid heavy machinery is digging up roads drain pipes are stacked along roadsides and it is quite plain to see that election campaigning has well and truly begun in this crowded suburban neighbourhood of delhi built on private land mohan gardens unauthorised colonies are among the  regularised colonies that have been allowed the sale and purchase of land one such colony is zaildar enclave home to about  houses former secretary the resident welfare association rwa of zaildar enclave ram kishen has been a resident since  kishen who retired from the air force says electricity and water supply were big problems back in the days when they had to depend on private suppliers in  we registered our rwa and applied to the government for electricity and water supply our colony was the first colony in mohan garden to get government electricity supply say kishen and now with regularisation a sewage system is finally being laid he says the work has started but it doesnt look  it will be a  percent successful the size of pipes being laid is not sufficient to carry sewage that is generated from these coloniesthese politicians want to get the publicity but at the same they see to it that the public doesnt get the full benefit this is how they function they seem to think that if in the first instance they deliver quality work they will lose their value and that the public will forget about them asked if the move to regularise the unauthorised colonies would ensure votes for the congress party in the next election former president of zaildar enclaves rwa gian chand answers indirectly people have spent so much money on building their homes at least now they dont have to worry about their homes being demolished for us it the basic necessities of life that are important we are not connected with the big corruption scandals we want water electricity we want our roads to be paved and that has been done he says congress mla mukesh sharma naresh sharmafirstpost but there are residents who feel the move is too little too late jai bhagwan is former president of another unauthorised colony in mohan garden that was regularised in september this is merely an election stunt the government has issued certificates of regularisation but what is the use the banks are still not willing to give us loans it will still be some time before the regularisation process is completewe have waited ten years to come this far it looks  we will have to wait a couple more before the process is complete this announcement is a mere political stunt says bhagwan listing the problems in his colony which is houses about  families he says there are multiple problems here we have to  hour long power cuts the drinking water is contaminated the roads are broken delhis unauthorised colonies are considered traditional strongholds of the congress sharma is frank about the congress strategy when it comes to cornering votes delhi has a population of about  crore in my assessment unauthorised colonies slum quarters resettlement colonies jj colonies and janta flats represent about  percent of the population and it is for this population that the congress has concentrated on it is in these colonies that schemes such as annashree yojagana pensions schemes for widows the elderly the minorities are happening he says he should know he defeated the bjp candidate by  votes in the last election his fourth straight victory the uttam nagar assembly constituency is among the biggest beneficiaries of the regularisation it has a population of  lakh and recorded a voter turnout of  percent last time around sharma adds just as a student works harder for his final exam we as politicians are working harder ahead of our final exam why shouldnt we we are not pujaris we are politicians and we work for votes this is part of democracy it is a numbers game that the congress government has succeeded in mastering in the last three years but can sheila dikshit do it a fourth time of the  colonies that have been regularised with added benefit of allowing sale and purchase of  the maximum number of colonies are situated in the west delhi district which is represented by congress candidate mahabal mishra in parliament majority of the regularised colonies fall in assembly constituencies won by the congress also because congress won  of the  assembly seats in  compared bjps  bsp won  ljp  and one independent candidate some of opposition bjp strongholds where colonies have been regularised include constituencies such as burari in north delhi palam and bijwasan in south west sangam vihar in the south rithala mundka and kirari in the north west karawal nagar and ghonda in the north east a huge chunk of colonies have been regularised in najafgarh where an independent candidate defeated the congress candidate by  votes in  constituencies from the where the bsp won badarpur in the south and gokulpuri in the north east too have benefitted from the regularisation drive overall the potential vote winning strategy of regularisation seems directed at consolidating the traditional votebase of the congress it has worked before

that really matter in india today tonight we look at the idea of justice the judiciary an integral pillar of indian democracy but also in an increasing focus with landmark judgments joining me tonight are a panel of finest judicial and legal minds retired justice raveendran retired justice ap shah mr soli sorabjee and prashant bhushan thank you all very much for coming tonight justice raveendran the focus really has been very much on the judiciary and the executive interface given the two recent judgments one of course on disqualifying politicians from office and also regarding rti on parties has come up though the cic as well these are issues again which should have been looked as judicial issues where issues of other pillars of democracy are standing up where the executive isnt do you think thats a correct interpretation justice raveendran well it is but the idea of justice is very broad and it varies from person to person perceptions also vary in fact the good old aristotelian definition is giving every person his due whether it may be a penalty and it may be a punishment or it may be his entitlement but we are not talking about global justice or we are not talking about social justice here we are talking about justice with reference to judges and judiciary now the problem is people have a perception that ju stice means it is truth it is fairness and it is equality it is all good things but they forget that justice what we render in courts is not justice according to morality but justice according to law therefore many a time we may be doing justice which people may not perceive as justice and vice versa in these cases which you refer the perception might be different the same matter came before one judge and he may take one view and another judge may take another view ndtv justice shah when we talk about consensus and looking at justice from the judiciarys perspectives looking at other perspectives the political perspective some of the arguments you have heard in recent years of judicial overreach the fact that judges arent elected who are they accountable to at least the politician is the force of public opinion increasingly however seems to lie with the judiciary do you think its a dangerous trend going forward justice shah there is criticism of judiciary saying that this has overreached this is judicial activism so according to one opinion this is not an aberration its normal judicial function according to some this is usurpation of power by the judicial branch if we look at the different trends in judiciary so prior to emergency i would say prior to maneka gandhis case judiciary was concerned to be orthodox it stood for the  owners and post emergency period the supreme court i mean stood up for it it became an institution trying to promote the idea of social justice which is the foundation of our constitution now just see how the things moved initially these pils started with those underprivileged people about their issues  child labour or prisoners or under trials i mean those are the issues which were about which the court was giving rulings this has slowly expanded into the larger issues the court went to larger issues  rule of law then the judicial appointments environment issues and then i feel that lately i mean the judiciary is entering into arenas which are i am not talking about these  judgments some objection to the for instance i will give you examples  for instance river linkage judgment the supreme court mandated there should be linking of rivers according to many experts its a bad idea and its not feasible but the supreme court ruled on the issue and not obeying a supreme court order would amount to contempt of court i mean thats nothing happened thereafter but according to even the

are areas  the one which is about the criminalisation of politics i mean the classic case is this lilly thomas the supreme court said that a convicted person would become automatically disqualified i mean one may say that a  judge bench should not have decided it referred it to larger bench but the i think the logic behind this judgment the undercurrent of the judgment is absolutely correct i mean the people largely supported the judgment so i feel there is tremendous pressure from the people i think the judiciary is regarded as the only protector of the democracy i mean that a citizen you as any common man that he will have highest faith in judiciary so i feel the interference in some cases may amount to encroachment on the executive but where the executive is completely inactive i mean this is where the cases where the executive has really has passed taken decisions which are unconstitutional surely the court has every reason to interferendtv mr sorabjee would you agree soli sorabjee well apart from cases where the supreme court strays into areas that have got no competence which everybody calls adventurism rare cases but i think the fundamental change which came about the supreme court after the emergency because in emergency judgment was horrible the habeas corpus decision can be as relieving act it shows that court started taking suffering seriously there cannot be mergers and  and other things and that even itself it gives a very broad interpretation to set the constitution provisions for example right to life this is not physically existence it is right to live with dignity and from that followed many other results which are beneficial it is true supreme court does over reach itself please dont remember in many cases the occasion where the judiciary intervention is that the executive doesnt implement the laws made by parliament or legislation so the courts say you made these laws and please implement them and my telling them is that they are not running the country asking them to implement the law because the result of nonimplementation may be the violation of human rights of some people for example young children working in dangerous occupations there are a lot of laws against that so the supreme court rightly interferes and then ensures the protection of the vulnerable segments of indian humanity which would otherwise be violated with impunityndtv the context however prashant of course we know that one bill which is now already through in rajya sabha thats a constitutional amendment bill for setting up a commission which will look at how judges are appointed we have lucid and heated arguments by kapil sibal the law minister arun jaitley looking at why this actually needs to announce some role of executive in a sense when i bring up this whole issue of the judiciaryexecutive clash may be a strong word but thats the part and power played that the judiciary is increasingly as justice shahs said perhaps the last pillar which is there complete faith in prashant bhushan no absolutely judicial activism started with this understanding that the role of judiciary is not merely to decide the disputes but also ensure that the other wings of state that the executive legislature function within their powers as well as do their duty particularly the executive and coupled with an expansive or a purposive interpretation of fundamental rights particularly the right to life which was held to mean not just the right to live an animal life but the right to live a life of dignity and have whatever is minimally necessary to lead of life of dignity and it was on the basis of that that judicial activism environment activism or this anticorruption activism etc has arisen because of the twin things the role of judiciary in ensuring the executive functions within its bounds as well as this purposive expansive interpretation of fundamental rights now obviously this has lead to great disquiet in a corrupt executive unfortunately in this country executives have successfully over a period of years become more and more corrupt and therefore abusing its power not doing their duty abandoning common people to virtually animal existence etc and therefore the judiciary had to step in and that is why there is this disquiet executive and a call for putting restraints on the judiciary and this bill the judicial appointments commission bill to some extent is motivated by that to somehow get a greater say in the appointment of judges ndtv and interestingly in fact that kapil sibal in parliament has said that he changed his own mind because when he was a lawyer had opposed the executive would have a role but i just wanted to quote some of those speeches in parliament when law minister kapil sibal said bhai bhatija giri talking about appointments arun jaitley also made a long speech but he raised the issue about the preretirement judgements being influenced by post retirement  he made the point also that the quest for a lutyens bungalow is also influencing the preretiring judges as a retired judge does it hurt you justice raveendran well it hurts me a lot first appointment of judges judges appointing judges came because a judgment was there the judgement said this is how it should be done what is the alternative let us assume the executive appoints executive if it does the job properly we will not be in the position we are in if in a coalition era lets us say if we have  judges and  politicians or  nominees of politicians what is going to happen with the undercurrents with the pressures of coalition partners anything can happen with the appointments i am not saying that when judges appoint themselves it is a hundred percent foolproof or good we cannot have a perfect system the judges are trying to do their best it may not be possible to achieve i would say to get perfection but a little transparency yes by members being there or some outside eminent persons being there is all right but packing the commission with nonjudges having a majority is certainly going to hurt this system yes they can change their mind if the opportunity is there if they can see what can happen if they could see into the future if  or  members particularly members who are not judges who are having some kind of political connection if they come to the commission the kind of havoc that can be played people if they think of it again they may change their views and as far as post retirement goes well you see it is very easy to say that some judges have given some judgment just for a lutyens bungalow or a job i would not say so you see many acts for retired judges heading commissions you just change the act why do you pervade that retired judges should be there sitting judges should be there nobody is asking that because there is a provision several acts saying that retired judges should be there and you should remember judges retire at the prime age of  when they have gained necessary experience to do some good in other countries  for life lawyers go on for  politicians dont have it we are getting i would not say maturity the experience and maturity and other thing that make a good judge when they approach that age they go home people are ready to go home some say all right if there is a provision of appointment what is wrong in taking appointment but to say that any judge would change his view and write judgment in favour of government to get a post retirement job it looks a little farfetched i mean having been a judge my view may not be i may be prejudiced in that sense i may be prejudicedsoli sorabjee no i agree with you thats not so and i know the judges but the public perception and public position must be maintained for the confidence of judiciary so why not have a cooling period i know its not there its generally believed and that is very important so i suggest we can have a cooling period before judges have been appointed to any or head any other commission prashant bhushan even better than that the easy solution to that is instead of leaving the post retirement appointments to a commission and tribunal etc in the hands of government put it in the hands of an independent judicial appointment commission let there be a full time judicial appointments commission yes and why notndtv i also want bring you in on that i dont know whether anyone has asked you before this but we all heard why many question were raised when you were not elevated to the supreme court and the questions being raised about you not elevated or other judges who answers those questions justice shah i do not wish to speak on that but i have a different view so this see this collegium system i mean its really according to me its abused to a large extent and its not only because i mean there are some times there are tee offs between the collegium it has sycophancy or lobbying has taken place it has also developed a certain type of servile culture in judiciary because the judges of high courts are aspiring to be judges of the supreme court so these judges appointing judges is not a good idea according to me the whole system is opaque but what happened in this case in this national judicial commission which is the bill passed according to me there several flaws in that first it was very hastily drafted without putting any thought in that first and foremost now mr sibal has conceded that it should be part of the constitution you cannot tamper you cannot lay down the composition of a judicial commission in ordinary law which can be altered any time it should be part of the constitutionsecondly prashant said and i agree with him i mean these acts that there will be committee of six and seven members and they will make the appointments to all high courts and supreme court it is virtually impossible to carry this kind of function now the act is completely silent on many issues what are the norms what is the process of where people can apply whether there can be nominations whether who will make nominations whether the chief justice of high court or some other why should there be no nomination an academician who will be consulted in matters of appointment now all this cannot be left what the act does it clearly says this is the composition of the commission and the rest is all procedure laid down by the commission which according to me is not a good thinking there are definitely drawbacks in the collegium system but when we go  years or so now the time has come we should adopt which is more  over recognized the judicial commission south africa the uk there are many other countries which follow this but for heavens sake there has to be more debate on this and it cannot be left merely to parliamentarians im surprised because of the level of debate i mean this what kind of debate is this particular observation you just now mentioned the bhai bhatija giri is a factthere is some nepotism but these are not considerations to discuss a bill which is going to replace the present system and which should also ensure its judicial independence is not affected in any way its a far more serious issue which i found not dealing with the major issue how you would constitute a commission its not an easy job whether its recommendatory whether its appointing a commission there are many issues there should be more debate on this and then they may evolve in the meantime its my belief that why these successive chief justices have not taken the note of criticism in the collegium system and try to make it more transparent and try to make it more comprehensive now just see i will give you two examples now this nepotism is a big issue now there were  barpassed resolutions one is madras bar and other bar association of punjab and haryana as a result some names were dropped now therefore there is something wrong with this system now why not the chief justice says yes these are the safeguards i would  to introduce till an alternative system is established why all the time sitting judges members of the collegium want to defend this system this system definitely it has drawbacks so they can themselves improve upon the system so the ultimately the executive will realise that there is no point in going ahead with thissoli sorabjee actually if you come to think of it the whole idea was the collegium system to prevent sarakri judges because we have in the end committed to kumar manglams ideology so that was the basic reason you dont want sarkari judges you dont mind executive that is also the original thing but as it has developed over the years i suppose as with any human institution there have been drawbacks even justice verma he expresses his satisfaction and the way it is working but that changed reasons for working what i am trying to say is keep this in mind what the primary objective was and actually the thinking is judges know much better about the judges of high court and about the lawyers who appear before them but if i may say in one sentence judiciary should have a dominant voice but not an exclusive voice justice shah i would say the judges must welcome this criticism they must understand that they are under constantly scrutiny it is very important for the i mean that at one time all this criticism could be suppressed with the power of contempt of court ndtv i must get prashant bhushan on that because you faced that as well but some did you feel there was perhaps too sweeping a statement you faced the threat of contempt prashant bhushan yes you see i was asked something about corruption in the judiciary and in response to that i said yes there is considerable corruption in the judiciary and the commonly held belief among some people or the commonly propagated belief particularly among the judiciary is that the level of corruption is very little at the top and increases at the bottom i said this is not a correct perception and then i said in my view about half of last  chief justices have been corrupt ndtv in fact isnt that sweeping statement without evidence prashant to make prashant bhushan no i gave evidence for that they challenged me to give i did you see i am not obliged to give evidence with my perception however because i was charged for contempt because they were persisting in that charge of contempt so therefore i gave evidence that this is the basis on which i believe a b c d e f g h were corrupt and in fact my father mr shanti bhushan even gave the names he also filed his affidavit etc its a fact that there has been considerable corruption in the judiciary there is no denying that there is no denying that there is no getting away from that either and that is why this kind controversies that you have mentioned chief justice of gujarat and a former chief justice between an earlier sitting chief justice today in supreme court and a former chief justice where there was this dispute about whether a judge from madras had sent a complaint about this raja talking to him on the phone to give bail and the chief justice said no no i was not given any name of any minister and then that other judge had to point out justice gokhale had to issue a press statement pointing out what the chief justice the former chief justice of india was saying it is false that i had myself written to him and given him the name of the minister who had spoken etcjustice raveendran well whether there is corruption in the judiciary and what level what percentage is also a perception some may have proof and some may not be proved but what is happening is by talking about corruption in the judiciary constantly the courts are being scandalized courts are not able to perform and they are getting nervous  a government officer now does not want to take a decision because it may be said that he is doing it for a consideration many government officers are avoiding taking decisions and a day may come when every action is suspect because we will find something peculiar about judiciary as far as judges are concerned they rendered judgment when we render judgment one party is satisfied one party will never be satisfied the loser will never be satisfied therefore there always will be a perception with the loser that something is wrong with the judge and sometimes many lawyers unscrupulously have said it may be on account of corruption every time an allegation is being made it may not really be corruption it may be ignorance and it may be perception of what law is not perception what facts are and to say for all and sundry reasons there is no corruption or decision consideration you know it damages the institution of democracy people justice shah just now is saying that at least people have some confidence in judiciary people go to court if some relief is to be given if we destroy the credibility of that institution where will people go people will go to local mafia people will go to police and try to get out of this thing let us not we should be very careful as prashant says that no corruption enters the judiciary and we should be vigilant and he being right in being vigilant i should also put a caveat that we should not be repeating seen to be repeating about corruption in judiciary without actual basis to give an impression to the public that judges are corrupt ndtv i completely agree undermining the institution justice shah you see the in my state as a judge in  high courts its my own experience that most of the judges havent i will say that they are very hard working with a dignity i sat with some of them i worked with them but i cannot say that i cannot rule out that some of the judges were inappropriately influenced by some constraints i mean justice raveendran rightly this the matter of perception rightly said its is a matter of perception but i entirely agree with him that if you go on repeating that here is corruption in judiciary its simply you are harming the institution so what is that we are not going to main issue how do you determine or investigate allegations of corruption against the judge and now thats the real issue according to me where there is no accountability there is no see ultimately i feel accountability has to do something with the public confidence in the impartiality and independence of the judiciary that is really the issue of accountability now if you have mechanism  impeachment for instance which is simply unworkable and i mean with  impeachments one failed and two persons resignedtoday the they have gone to the extreme accountability bill which i believe just i will take  minutes on that the impeachment says only  members must initiate in the lok sabha and  in the rajya sabha and then along can it be initiated so this is defective mechanism but its very important that you cannot and i mean put the judges career in jeopardy because somebody thinks about it now this accountability bill according to me is one of the absolute draconian laws which says that any person can file a complaint against a judge even the government then that complaint will go before a committee called judicial oversight committee that committee will consist of  members now they wanted to put some politician fortunately that is avoided then that committee acts  a post box and it sends the complaint to a scrutiny committee which consists of judges of the same court  judges and a retired chief justice and they are supposed to inquire if there is a prima facie case against the judge and then they will make reference to the larger committee and thereafter there will be inquiry etc according to me this particular bill is completely violates article  what the article says is that parliament is given power to lay down the procedure or initiation of that impeachment process but it doesnt give power to create a completely new mechanism that mechanism is really frightening that anyone can make a complaint against any judge and that complaint has to be investigated see this is not followed even in government departments as chief justice i am telling you i used to receive hundreds of complaints most of the complaints were completely false because somebody loses the case ndtv mr sorabjee taking it beyond because i think we have also spent a lot of time focusing on this the key part but taking it beyond this the idea of justice for the ordinary citizen for an average petitioner who approaches court the issue of backlog the issue of judge to citizen ratio we are talking about fast track courts and many asked why shouldnt every case be considered the same importance what is slow track where are we on these key issues even in terms of thinking about addressing them with seriousness on part of the government the judiciary i know has been asking to fill up vacancies but again when they have for all this to be done there has been slowness on the judicial part as well where are we on these issues soli sorabjee well about the backlog there are three tiers first the government our ratio of judge to the population is woefully short number one we havent got enough judges besides judges who are appointed are not very able and there are other considerations and some not always there is no infrastructure the judge who represents the subordinate court has no stenographer he writes something takes the evidence there is no library so the government has to see that part secondly i am sorry my  the legal fraternity also responsible for these arrears and there are certain lawyers known in delhi as adjournment lawyers they are briefed only to get an adjournment because once an interim say is obtained then every trick in the book is used leave against dysentery client gets diarrhoeandtv there are cases over  years just in delhi soli sorabjee these things happen unfortunately judges are not strict enough i mean they dont  to refuse judgments not to dismiss their own lawyers maybe the thing is that they are not running a popularity contest they must be strict in this regard as i said three tiers government judiciary and the legal fraternity so heres a crusade of areas where all three have to act in coordination ndtv i think it has to be crusade and that has soli sorabjee for any reason not filling up of vacancies which are known to occurjustice shah just see the governments approach in  mr moily was law minister the then law minister said that they will create  ad hoc appointments to clear the arrears one appointment was made one year back or even before that i think i am part of that committee judicial reforms committee where it was promised that the it will be increased by at least  so it will be done gradually you cant have  judges in one go so it has to be done gradually then at least  new posts every year not one post new post is created so apart from that just see the infrastructure and number of judges apart from that our laws have become archaic all our procedural courts etc if you see around say singapore thailand or other countries say europe everywhere the procedural laws have been amended our laws our procedural laws are completely archaic we dont have anything worthwhile mentioning about case management or docket management and we have a backlog of  crore this is impossible a life span of a civil case today is not less than  years i mean i am not talking about appeal to the supreme court ordinarily the court to the district court to the high court i am just taking that period and it is so shocking that the appeals against acquittal take for instance a court  allahabad a criminal appeal it was against acquittal it was allowed somewhere around after  years  years and the man was sent to jail and it was allowed and he was convicted for murder so where are we heading so this should be the first priority of the judges of the judiciary this is what i feel ndtv no in fact justice raveendran lalu prasad yadav convicted after  years rasheed masood again convicted after  years i mean everyone is very elated about this judgment but look at how long they have taken justice raveendran i agree there is delay in courts it is proverbial delay and courts are always connected but please remember that in rendering judgments judiciary is not the only stakeholder there are prosecutors there are investigators if the investigation is bad or investigation is lopsided or investigation is delayed there is delay there are you would surprised to know that there are courts three courts or two courts with one prosecutor therefore the judge waits for the prosecutor who has gone to the next court because no case can go on in his court until the prosecutor comes therefore prosecutors sometimes are not well trained they are not in a position to present the cases they are subject to political influences therefore when it comes to a decision yes i would say lack of adequate number of judges is one reason the other reasons are also there of course as he rightly said there should be more modernization of courts and procedures the laws the archaic laws should go and the system of our writing judgments hundreds of pages of judgments should somehow be cut and there should also be a system of cutting short the appeals we have now every matter would you believe it the supreme court gets cases where an injunction temporary injunction has been refused or granted a bail is refused or granted an adjournment is refused and granted a special leave petition is filed and with this it has to be done and it is being doneand as you rightly pointed out somewhere down the line a young lawyer appears somebody wants to encourage him or a senior lawyer whose word has to be respected appears notice is issued things happen you see no other country in united states the supreme court takes  cases per term thats all no hearing no preliminary hearing at all no oral hearing in supreme court here you would be surprised to know mondays and fridays the entire day entire two days judges do only preliminary work and for doing that preliminary work they read for four days for four full days if those judges had four full days for doing the other work the disposals will increase of course some are systematic problems some are judgment problems ndtv perhaps the raising the retirement age because that in itself would help the backlog that prashant that point of justice delayed justice denied also a larger issue the criminal justice system because we talked about pressure on public prosecutor the person who represents the victim the state helping the victim here the irony is that i talk about the uphaar case judgment many others where you appeared as well where the victim is left with burden of an overburdened government system the ones that can have the best lawyers you can have adjournment lawyers  soli sorabjee said have access to best resources now the cbi say suddenly taking outside lawyers senior advocates appear for them the system seems currently slanted against the victim prashant bhushan not just slanted against the victim no its slanted against any poor common man because ndtv pil have helped them though prashant bhushan pil some people not whole lot of them you see today a person who cannot afford a lawyer and  percent of the population of the country cannot afford a lawyer really cannot even access the judicial system of this country because the procedures are so complex that they can only be accessed by a lawyer who understands those procedures not by a common person so if you are a common person and you have been charged with an offence by the police street vendor charge sheeted by the police for something or the other he is virtually at the mercy of the police or the judge he cant even defend himself actually you really ask the question how many people in this country are able to get justice through this judicial system in this country the honest answer in my view would be not even  percent because  percent cannot even access the system out of the remaining  percent  percent of their cases linger around by the time they get decided eventually lost intermittently the whole purpose so therefore and even those which do get decided quickly very often wrongly because of incompetence or sometimes because of corruption in the judiciary also so we have a huge problem it requires addressing this problem it requires redesigning the judicial systems so that judiciary can be accessed without lawyers it needs to be made so informal that a common person should be able to come and say look my cow has been stolen by this person please help me and that judicial system should be able to respond to such a cry of even an illiterate person but unfortunately thats not the case ndtv we are now in the final round of final phase of this dialogue mr sorabjee the impact as i said of the supreme court judgment on disbarring convicted politicians the impact of sending two former chief ministers in fact three mr chautala lalu prasad yadav mr jaganath mishra and different cases being sent to jail by courts the impact that supreme court in the larger climate of democracy today how important do you think that really issoli sorabjee thats very good it sent the right signal that crime does not eventually pay it may take time you see there are so many factors but remember despite everything you ask a man on the street this is an important commission to be appointed is he happy with just the secretary we want the judge that is so no some times even say not retired judges even the sitting judge but this confidence we must preserve one thing i want to say i would not  to tendency of some people and some counsel who dont say the judgment was harmonious but judgment was dishonest that sort of mental makeup i do not appreciate at all the judgment which has gone against you need not to be dishonest it can be erroneous dont do that off course weed out corruption dont magnify aise hi justice raveendran said if you weed out the confidence what will happen you will go to local mafia kitna time chaiye khaali karo kaahey kyun khaali karega nai khaali karega strong arm tactics and where do we go so this is thing we must recognize the menace of corruption but we must also devise proper methods of losing doing it and in that i dont think we should have wholesale confirmation of judiciary because from my experience i know judges in court i have known are honest conscientious we dont want any rotten eggs rotten eggs have tarnished the image but majority of them are confidently hardworking honest and conscientious but there are rotten eggs its unfortunate  years back if someone said judge is dishonest wed think he had a drink or he is crazy now these things are taken seriously that is what happens and even it means very drastic action and as far as an erring judge is concerned and all are for it providing he has the opportunity of defending himself impeachment procedure is cumbersomeits proved to be useless it has got politicised lets devise another procedure and i would be very clear in the accountability commission or whatever no lay person or you will have a person who has been defeated is dumped they think isme paisa khaya hai there it must be by people of money of eminence people of credibility confidence but not lay persons on that justice verma and i had a were completely at one ndtv it opens up a conversation of ideas and issues that are really crucial to democracy i want to thank you all for being part of it justice raveendran justice shah soli sorabjee and prashant bhushan thank you all for all coming tonight"},{"Date":"8 Mar

response to corruption as individuals and corporates ranges from outrage to ambivalence the bribegiver gets away in this scenario corruption may be a hardy perennial in indian public life but every once in a while it bursts into even more exuberant foliage currently thanks to congress general secretary rahul gandhis ordinance bomb followed by the conviction of several political luminaries in various corruption cases and their consequent disqualification from holding public office the issue is once again the subject of heated debate amongst the talking heads population of various television studios which is all to the good as the father of the nation mahatma gandhi whose birth anniversary was perfunctorily observed last week famously remarked sunlight is the best disinfectant for corruption the more sunlight that falls on the issue the more corruption gets exposed the better the chances of finally getting to grips with the problem or so logic would dictate unfortunately when it comes to corruption logic has had little to do with the way people have reacted to it take the issue of the presence of criminals in politics the fact that almost a third of our elected representatives in parliament and state legislatures are facing criminal charges of one kind or the other has been repeated ad nauseam but most have overlooked the fact that in a vast majority of these cases the said criminal charges had been made before these worthies got elected the conclusion is inescapable at the individual level at least being criminally tainted is clearly no disadvantage when it comes to winning elections in other words voters at the individual level do not appear to care very much about the issues of crime and corruption when it comes to electing their representatives at the wholesale level of course electorates have behaved differently in the past punishing governments which were perceived as extremely corrupt in fact the newlyformed aam aadmi party is banking so heavily on this wholesale anticorruption sentiment working in its favour in the elections that it has made fighting corruption almost its sole poll plank at the establishment level too our attitude to corruption has been filled with rhetoric but little concrete action a recent report by the un office on drugs and crime unodc pointed out that while the government has as many as  different ministries at the central level alone it does not have any laws or central mechanisms on public procurement at the state level the picture is only marginally better only two states karnataka and tamil nadu have legislation on public procurement according to the unodc report the general financial rules  under which most of the public procurement is done is not a law does not mandate compliance and has little to say on publicprivate procurement the penalties are also not severe india became a signatory to the un convention against corruption uncac in may  one of the key requirements of becoming a signatory is to enact legislation which is compliant with the convention here again we are doing great on paper the public procurement bill  and the draft rules for publicprivate partnerships  are both compliant with the uncac however they are yet to see the light of actual legislative action it is a supreme irony here that the frequent disruption of parliament usually on corruptionrelated issues has been repeatedly cited by the government as the reason for not getting more laws passed the unodc report also recommends another key action on which there has been little public discussion in india that of widening the definition of public officials and bringing the private sector into the ambit of anticorruption legislation this is not surprising both in public policy and public debate we have always tended to focus on the bribetakers but not on the bribegivers the private sector arguably the generator of wholesale corruption in india has often waxed eloquent on the pervasiveness of corruption in india and the need to clean up public life but has little to show when it comes to taking concrete measures to fight this menace at the individual company level a recent survey by risk analysis firm control risks international  attitudes to corruption indian perspectives points out some startling gaps between perception and reality in the corporate sector on the issue of combating corruption corruption is a part of life for those doing  in india some  per cent said they regularly faced demands for what control risks terms operational bribes demands to ensure smooth running of their businesses from police officers customs and tax inspectors and the  but only onethird of the companies surveyed admitted to having a formal policy in place against giving bribes the report said the lack of a clear antibribery policy was a serious deficiency and even if a corporate employees conscience troubled him it would be foolish to expect him to do anything about it only  per cent less than a quarter of the respondents said they have a whistleblower mechanism where employees can raise issues in confidence with indias whistleblower act still in legislative limbo this means that a potential whistleblower has neither internal nor external protection one reason for this is that most indian companies may be upset by the endless demands for bribes but do not actually see it as a serious  risk an astonishing  per cent of the companies in the survey felt it was somewhat or very unlikely that they would come under investigation for suspected corruption offences in other words most indian companies may dislike having to pay bribes but do not expect or fear punishment for doing so although every act of corruption requires a giver and a taker of bribes it is time to change this it may be too much to expect the hapless common man to stop indulging in retail corruption altogether the power of the bribedemanders to disrupt his life is too great his ability to bring such corrupt public servants to book limited but we could make a start by at least restricting the wholesale supply of bribes and the vast engine of misgovernance which it fuels we could make a start by pushing forth the agenda of legislative reform by passing the whistleblower bill or the prevention of corruption amendment bill and the private sector could back its indignation with concrete action by setting in place clear anticorruption policies protecting whistleblowers and training employees in anticorruption practices and how to resist demands for bribes if we cant stop the taking lets at least try and restrict the giving response to raghavansthehinducoin "},{"Date":"25 Sep

still ranks high in terms of corruption transparency international publishes a report in which it ranks countries on the basis of corruption last year corruption perception index ranked india ranked  out of  countries india earned a very low score of  on a scale from  most corrupt to  least corrupt with the cause of corruption principally attributed to the amount of bribe being paid to government officials although there is no specific macrolevel study quantifying the impact of corruption on a countrys growth rate there is a strong correlation between rich countries and the lower level of corruption countries such as denmark finland sweden and singapore are some of the richest economies in the  and with minimal levels of corruption at another extreme we find economically poor countries such as somalia afghanistan and myanmar with very high levels of corruption countries  italy greece and ireland which are mired in financial crisis have fallen rapidly in terms of their ranking on the corruption index since the corruption index is based on perception countries with higher corruption are also less attractive for foreign firms richer countries are the more trusted ones in terms of

down to  billion for  to stem corruption there is need for both political and judicial reform investors will not be willing to invest if there is delay in settlement of disputes recent data on disposal of court cases are not available but in  more than  cases in the supreme court more than four million in the high courts and over  million cases in subordinate courts were awaiting disposal considering the total number of outstanding cases every judge in the country will have an average load of about  cases india has  judges as against the sanctioned strength of  including  high court judges this works out to a ratio of  judges per million population this ratio is going to become more adverse with more and more people becoming literate for example in a relatively more literate

were accepted for hearing in the supreme court for the us this figure is around  per cent it is easy to go in appeal from a lower court to a higher court say supreme court this adds to the backlog to

literary festival recently that most of the corrupt are from the scheduled castes scheduled tribes and other backward classes have caused a national furore then there are the two sides those from the media and liberals urging those who are protesting to view his remarks in their entirety and fathom his prodalit stance and overzealous politicians who are baying for nandys blood and wanting him arrested for violating the scheduled castes and tribes prevention of atrocities act  in the cacophony rational and irrational voices have made it difficult for educated dalits to break the impasse by engaging in meaningful dialogue over the issue let me clarify that i am against the arrest of mr nandy his remarks though misguided certainly do not qualify to be categorised as profoundly hateful promoting enmity or inciting violence applying the provisions of scst act for a supposedly innocuous speech would mean doing gross injustice to nandy as well as to the freedom of speech and expression that is guaranteed under the constitution in the same way it also bestows protesters the right to air their grievances even if nandy is a celebrated sociologist it does not in any way place him above criticism of any kind an objective scrutiny and an analysis of his clarifications are needed more so because his generalised statements are likely to affect the sensitivities of the majority of our population was his speech really innocuous or as he has said prodalit personally i feel that if not grossly prejudiced his remarks were misguided nandy had observed it is a fact that most of the corrupt come from scs sts and obcs and as long as this continues our republic will survive its ambiguous and bizarre nature should prove beyond doubt that he was expressing his opinion there is no empirical data to back it and it seems to be coloured by his own judgment what is more troublesome about the whole episode is that the nandyesque style of stating something as fact which quickly turned to hypothesis and later into a sugarcoated explanation masquerading as a prodalit stance proves that the  was baseless and illfounded nandy argues that his fact must be considered in a positive sense as the newly emergent corrupt from the disempowered and marginalised communities have found their way to work through the system they manage to defy the law to suit their personal interests and gain access to resources hitherto denied to them let me examine his explanation at face value he proclaims that the poor and the dispossessed use corruption as a means for upward mobility which he states should be a reason for celebration further the kind of corruption that the elite and privileged classes indulge in is invisible however the backward classes get trapped in the cobwebs of the legal system which ends up penalising them unjustifiably even though the malady of corruption impregnates every class let us deal with the nuances of his utterances about corruption at length to decipher the hidden meaning of his pseudoscientific claims i am reminded of the barnum effect the kind of strategy employed by proponents of the pseudo sciences   and palmistry keep the statement general with a little something for everyone and it will please nearly everyone nandy has successfully utilised the same strategy by making loose ended statements that are open to multiple interpretations at one go his remarks and subsequent justifications can be termed variously as being prodalit or antidalit proindian or antiindian procorruption or anticorruption herein lies the enormous danger of accepting his arbitrary clarifications which only become the basis for people harbouring all kinds of prejudices to conform to their own previously held biases this in turn increases the psychological gap between various warring groups instead of promoting harmony corruption is corruption nandy has classified corruption as being visible and the invisible the former he says is the kind of strategy deployed by the backward classes to move up the ladder by subverting the laws of the land first by dividing corruption this way or by derivation into good corruption and bad corruption is in itself a selfdefeating and futile exercise corruption is an evil in every form and sense and whatever manifestation it takes it must be abhorred in every way the root cause of corruption of all hues and shades is moral depravity unless this is addressed this hydraheaded monster will keep surfacing eventually engulfing the very ethos that provides stability to our social fabric while ensuring zero corruption might as well be a gargantuan and almost unachievable task the mere reason that such a utopian society cannot be envisaged should not be used as an excuse to turn a blind eye to it if not to zero keep it at minimal levels for that to happen we need to wage a continuous war against it and at all levels there should be no excuses to support the looting of public money and resources needless to say corruption cannot be treated as the exclusive preserve of public officials unless corruption at a societal level is dealt with pointing fingers and making laws are no remedy gaining access to resources through corruption even at socalled acceptable levels is an exercise of selfaggrandisement it is worrisome if at all any person whatever caste heshe may belong to is forced to indulge in such a form of corruption what is that motivates nandy to take it as a reason for celebration instead of being a matter for serious introspection can the republic survive long enough if we continue masking this degraded practice with flawed raison dêtre  the kind nandy extols going by his proposals the lower classes resorting to corruption to acquire resources that should be available to all in a society founded on the principles of justice and equality validates the failure of the state to provide equitable access to resources to all irrespective of caste applying this logic what has been proposed as a recipe for survival of the republic is indeed a recipe for anarchy the same rationale has also been used by antireservationists to bring forth their flawed argumentation that it is reservation for the lower castes that has allowed corruption to flourish and that unless this is withdrawn corruption will continue unabated nandys dissertation perhaps in an unintended way has provided opportunists an excellent chance to denying the single window of hope open to the marginalised to procure resources through reasonable and legal means instead of acquiring them using unjust ways the very division of people on the basis of tactics used for corruption ends up in the imaginary separation of people on the basis of caste this defeats the very purpose of the annihilation of the caste system such a vague classification of people by attaching their identity of caste and related insecurity with visible forms of corruption or by the ways and means of achieving equality through unjust modes results in unintended and evil consequences of providing life support to the deadly monster of caste it also strikes a blow against the very cause of the eradication of caste by not providing any prescription whatsoever for the current set of laws to effectively deal with corruption nandy has implicitly or explicitly placed the burden of responsibility on the shoulders of the lower castes for the failure of the state as well as the loopholes in the legal system his orwellian doublespeak at once points a finger at the lower castes for the menace of corruption while applauding them simultaneously for finding unique and exemplary ways of procuring their rightful place in the society no equaliser even if we were to presume that the lower castes indulge in socalled visible corruption it can never ensure equitable access to resources for all because such means can be accessed only by those a handful who have gained entry into public service while the vast majority of dispossessed lower castes still live on the brink of survival crores of public money accumulated by the likes of former jharkhand chief minister madhu koda is of no use to them therefore nandys pronouncement that when the likes of koda arrive centrestage he likes it is again indicative of the fact that his view of good corruption is jaundiced corruption can never act as an equaliser rather it increases inequality by further increasing the raising divide between haves and havenots if nandy was ever serious about eradicating the evil of caste he should have exhorted the state and society to engage in the task of uplift of the backward classes instead of rubbing salt into their wounds yet he is not alone in using his rhetoric in hailing corruption that he ascribes to the lower castes the left liberal intelligentsia and the media need to  the blame equally for refusing to listen to our grievances or sometimes even brazenly attacking us as being elite anticasteists who have suddenly woken up to take advantage of the situation to assert our superiority therein lies the deepest problem by labelling us this and by ignoring our justified demands they have exposed their own hypocrisy we have been trying to draw attention to historical injustices and which continue that we have suffered if the others have not bothered to listen then the problem lies with them rabindranath tagore once said my unfortunate country you will have to come down from your pedestal and acknowledge those as your equals who you have humiliated those that have been deprived of their human rights and those that you have not embraced to your bosom you will be forced to descend to their level one day it is a warning with contemporary relevance the lower castes have displayed virtues of tolerance and forgiveness for generations but to expect them to show the same even at the cost of their selfrespect would mean draining blood from one who is already anaemic a tolerance for casteism and a tolerance for corruption will unavoidably result in promoting casteism and corruption that i am very sure will sound the death knell for our surviving republic anjali

the sting operation conducted by zee news crime and investigation team unravelled in an engineering college in up recently stating seeking capitation fees from students as illegal and unethical the supreme court had recently asked the centre to make laws to put an end to such practices which deny admission to meritorious financially poor students in those institutions the court had observed that quality of education has gone down in private colleges which are turning into students financing institutions it said that government agencies need to introspect on the issue to bring proper legislation collection of large amount by way of capitation fee running into crores of rupees for mbbs and postgraduate seats exorbitant fee donation etc by many of such self financing institutions have kept the meritorious financially poor students away from those institutions the sc said the zee news sting operation was conducted after the investigation team received complaints of corrupt practices at gl bajaj college in up when approached by a zee news reporter who pretended to be a candidate seeking admission in the colleges electronic and telecommunication engineering wing a college receptionist told the reporter that enrolment was possible only after payment of donations during the discussion the receptionist added donations would differ based on streams students opt for she

discussion with the official the consultants persuaded the reportercandidate who claimed to be hailing from lucknow to secure room at the college hostel the official responds saying he will look into it and asks the reporter to see him after three days the reporter though did not approach the college later as the aim of the operation was only to unearth ill practices going on at educational

feisty young officer was used to veiled threats from the quarrying mafia in western uttar pradesh but what she had not bargained on while taking them on was punitive action from the government against her surely she had stepped on big toes after ordering her suspension the government justified the action citing that nagpals actions could have caused communal tensions however not many in the state are ready to  it the demolition of a mosque boundary wall political observers here believe is an alibi for the government to shift the  batch ias officer she had been suspended because she ordered the demolition of a religious place read mosque especially in the month of ramzan this is a sensitive issue and could have caused communal tension said chief minister akhilesh yadav incidentally the demolition of the wall under the supervision of nagpal was part of an antiencroachment drive and as per local authorities there was no adverse reaction to it from the locals let alone any communal tension the demolition was done following the supreme court order which restricts the construction of any religious structure without the permission of the local administration nagpal had told the local media reports from various quarters confirm that the suspension was the result of her aggressive approach to curb the sand mafia active in the western up after being posted at gautam buddha nagar her first posting she had launched an extensive drive against the illegal quarrying of sand and soil which is rampant on the yamuna and hindon river beds every day contractors dig tonnes of sand and mud worth lakhs of rupees without legal sanction the loss from these activities to the revenue department is huge a month ago she had got cases registered against more than  people involved in illegal quarrying and over  had been arrested in less than a fortnight she also ensured about two dozen jcb machines involved in illegal quarrying were seized she had also threatened that there would be no letup in the fight against unauthorized dredgers the entire district has been affected and illegal mining has become a huge problem the stakes are too high and those involved get huge monetary returns the act could lead to serious environmental issues and therefore needs to be stopped a pti report quoted her saying the contractors are known for their alliances with and affinities to the high and mighty of the ruling parties irrespective of who was in power bundelkhand was the hub of quarrying activities during the rule of the bahujan samaj party the contractors were active in the area under the patronage of ministers  badshah singh and babu singh kushwaha under the samajwadi party western up has become the hub of quarrying sources close to the government claim that a large chunk of the quarrying activities in the region is controlled by one narendra bhati who is known to be close to the ruling party he had suffered most due to the arrests and seizures made by nagpal the government is giving a lame excuse for nagpals suspension the reality is that the government is trying to save the mafia and it had been waiting for some excuse to shift the officer from the site said lk bajpai the state president bjp if maintaining communal harmony is the reason for the suspension then why has the government not suspended all those senior officials who failed to check the series of riots that has taken place in the state since the sp government came to power he added the suspension came suddenly no report was sought from the district magistrate or the commissioner in this regard and no call was made to the sdm before the suspension order was served this is the way the sp government functions the person who tries to confront the mafia and criminals is either transferred or suspended said sc mishra bsp general secretary akhilesh does not seem to have much of a defense my government is criticised if no action is taken and when we take an action against the erring

politics in a fiery speech that hinted his party may accept support from the congress party to form a coalition government in delhi kejriwal a former civil servant turned politician has been under mounting pressure to form a coalition government since his partys stunning performance at  december state elections kejriwal is wary of joining forces with the congress party or the main opposition bharatiya janata party bjp after voters flocked to his party disillusioned with mainstream politics and angry over rampant corruption but in hints that it may assume power on the back of a positive response to its weeklong public referendum kejriwal said aap will meet lt governor najeeb jung on monday to apprise him about the partys decision kejriwal whose oneyearold party had its roots in the anticorruption movement said a final decision on government formation will be announced on monday after analyzing the results of the weeklong referendum through sms ivrs and email and from the public meetings conducted over the weekend though we have got the overwhelming participation of people during the public meetings and about  of them have favoured that party should form the government but the final decision would be taken after a meeting of political affairs committee kejriwal told pti after this he said he would be meeting jung at pm on monday if we form the government we will pass the anticorruption law and send corrupt bjp and congress leaders to jail kejriwal earlier told a rally in delhi of several hundred supporters we are not after political power we want to change the system and cleanse the dirty politics aam aadmi party won  of the  seats at the polls for an assembly trouncing the ruling congress which took eight and depriving the biggest winnerthe bjp with of a majority aaps success only a year after its formation signalled its emergence as a new political force which poses a threat to indias two main parties at general elections next year aap has until now refused to accept support from either the congress or the bjp fuelling criticism that they were running away from the responsibility of forming government aap has sought opinion on whether to form government in delhi holding public meetings and asking supporters to telephone or sms their thoughts in a move that taps into its grass roots base the hindustan times newspaper and other media reported sunday that aap has received an overwhelming response from the public in favour of forming a new government we have got a very positive and clear response if things go the same way today we will definitely form the government the daily quoted an aap leader manish sisodia as saying congress in power at the national level for a decade has seen its popularity plummet following a slew of corruption scandals and policy paralysis that has been partly blamed for indias faltering economy we have some six months to go for general elections and we feel the congress will dare not play any dirty tricks with us till then kejriwal said to loud applause from supporters it is only the beginning we will clean the whole country he added bjp criticized aaps move to seek public opinion for forming a government with congress support in an article released by the bjp leader of the opposition in rajya sabha arun jaitley pointed out that aap had categorically stated it stands for alternative politics and is guided by idealism how does aap justify a volte face where it seems to be compromising on its commitments of alternative politics obviously political opportunism should

reddy was the state minister for forests environment science and technology he was first elected on a congress ticket in  and before this he was a contractor for irrigation projects construction real estate and mining his company plr projects is part a joint venture which bagged several jalayagnam projects worth rs  crore another congress mla komatireddy venkata reddy reportedly has stakes in the sriramsagar project packages no  and  worth rs  crore the individual stakes of these family companies of mpsmlas may be higher because many of them are allegedly working as vendor contractors of foreign companies in the name of joint ventures many foreign companies  the russian zvs chinese companies sino hydro and crg who are part of the joint ventures with these politiciancontractors are allegedly missing on the ground even the state government has conceded this point to the comptroller and auditor general cag during the preparation of the audit performance report of jalayagnam the cag has raised doubts about the completion of the jalayagnam project it has in fact called the project infeasible because andhra pradesh is a powerdeficit state and it will require over rs  crore per annum to energise the  lift irrigation plants planned under jalayagnam the government is now saddled with a huge number of projects whose completion will take long and the sustainability of many projects is becoming doubtful on account of inadequate availability of water and power the financial burden of these incomplete projects and associated contracts on the state exchequer will be felt for a long time to come says the cag report the state government however appears to be rather unapologetic aggressive and optimistic on the jalayagnam front two main canals right and left are more or less ready but the pump station is yet to be constructed to pump water into these canals the state government is perhaps preparing to issue another tender for the maintenance of these unused canals in

about the new rs  notes dec    ist adarsh scam best bombay high court criticalpoint devyani khobragade india maharashtra assembly mumbai politics uttam khobragade by ivor soans now that temperatures over the devyani khobragade arrest in the united states are cooling down perhaps its time to take a more measured look at the entire affair and look at the larger controversy that devyani is involved in or at least the one that more common indians would be interested in given the widespread frustration with corruption the us has made soothing noises about what happened in new york even while it strongly holds to its position that khobragade violated us law and us attorney and prosecutor preet bharara seemingly terming devyani a liar by claiming she wasnt handcuffed or restrained and was accorded courtesies well beyond what other defendants are accorded which extended to use of her phone devyani khobragade while a strip search seems way too excessive the indian government and various political parties have been all sound and fury on devyanis us arrest with some  yashwant sinha even saying partners of gay american diplomats should be arrested as homosexuality is a crime in india perhaps not realising that this would put india in the august company of the most repressive regimes in the  as also the infamous taliban however as a columnist points out in a measured article on the question of diplomatic immunity in dna the fact is the indian government is yet to deny the fraudulent visa application for which khobragade has been charged the columnist goes on to add that the us would be well within its rights to declare devyani persona non grata so even as its clear that there are two sides to every coin how about looking at devyani khobragade and the infamous adarsh scam that rocked india a few years ago and which is again in the news thanks to the maharashtra government seemingly trying its very best to avoid tabling the adarsh commission report in the legislative assembly and thus making it public added to this is the fact that the maharashtra governor k sankaranarayanan has refused to allow the cbi the mandatory goahead for prosecution of former chief minister ashok chavan who lost his job in the wake of the adarsh scam this decision seems suspicious given that cbi sources told the times of india they had strong evidence against chavan and they had made an extensive presentation to the maharashtra governor to back up their request for sanction to prosecute chavan adarsh leapt to the national limelight in  when the cooperative housing society built on allegedly defence land and supposedly for kargil war widows and defence personnel was found to have flats owned by politicians and their relatives as well as relatives of bureaucrats clearly pointing to a land grab at one of mumbais most lucrative locations devyani khobragade owns a flat in the infamous adarsh her father uttam khobragade was one of the bureaucrats who allegedly misused their positions to help adarsh it was during his tenure as general manager of best the civicowned bus and electricity utility in mumbai that the adarsh society got additional building rights from an adjacent best bus depot this allowed the society promoters to increase the original plan of six floors to a massive  floors while the khobragades may want us to believe this is mere coincidence only other bureaucrats and politicians caught with their hands in the adarsh till may take such a claim at face value thats not all when it comes to devyanis real estate holdings in mumbai when she got the adarsh flat she already owned a flat in another government housing society in oshiwara which too was allotted under the state governments  per cent quota where recipients get flats at extremely cheap rates as compared to mumbais stratospheric market prices and which is another fount of corruption in mumbai with most flats cornered by politicians and their relatives and of course bureaucrats and their relatives and those connected to their powers that be making a mockery of the  percent quota supposedly for helping citizens who need it most as the economic times reports a massive  percent of such flats allocated in the past  years were resold by allottees at much higher prices making a killing in the bargain at the expense of the taxpayer and the common indian things have become so bad with the  percent quota that the bombay high court recently warned the maharashtra government of contempt if it continued to stonewall requests to name double and multiple allottees of such flats in devyanis case what makes the issue even murkier is the guideline which states that no one can get flats in two housing societies which get land on concessional rates and they have to give an affidavit to this effect however when uttam khobragade was asked about this violation and material nondisclosure of facts on the part of devyani by the adarsh commission he said that it was not his duty to inform the adarsh cooperative society that devyani had also been allotted a flat in oshiwara under the  percent quota however does this mean that devyani has submitted a fraudulent affidavit at adarsh to get the adarsh flat this is a question that needs to be answered and paper trail can easily prove this meanwhile leave alone devyani and her possible aspirations to become a mumbai real estate mogul the maharashtra government is trying its very best to push the storey adarsh jack back into its box even when its clear that the judiciary and the opposition in the state is in no mood to let this come to pass in a shocking flipflop that might be funny if it were not for the fact that the government has spent rs  crore on the commission enquiring into the scam and the many more crores may be lost in illegal gains sought to be made by beneficiaries of adarsh the maharashtra government first told the bombay high court it would table the adarsh commission report as required in the maharashtra legislative assembly and then backtracked by claiming it was only a verbal promise when the bombay high court was not amused with the contortions being performed by the government and this was belatedly realised by the state a new promise was made that the report would be tabled in the winter session of the maharashtra assembly that ends on  december so more worms will likely come out of the woodwork when the report is tabled and while devyani khobragades new york arrest and the resulting fracas may be close to being pushed under the carpet as saner heads take over in washington and new delhi the last has not been heard on devyani khobragades adarsh controversy that includes not just her but many powerful politicians and bureaucrats and is definitely the controversy the common indian would be more interested in getting to the bottom of first published on dec    ist afghanistan in united arab emirates  t international series  uae vs afg afghanistan beat united arab

sudarshan ballal medical director and chairman of indias third largest healthcare company manipal health enterprises manipal hospitals feels public faith in medical professionals has significantly eroded and that the fraternity is itself responsible for this situation he spoke to ashish k tiwari on corruption in the medical profession among other topics edited excerpts corruption seems to have seeped into this noble profession and doctors medical practitioners are being alleged with it every now and then your  i think what doctors are these days is the reflection of society corruption is there everywhere in the society and it is bound to be there in the doctors  as well we are in an extremely noble profession and we dont want to see corruption here but unfortunately the presence of it is there there are various instances of wrong diagnosis treatment surgery etc by doctors i am sure there is truth to this and i would lie if i say there is nothing  this but as far possible the hospitals should follow honest and ethical practices of medicine what do you have to say on the decreasing faith in doctors these days there is a lot of corruption still and indeed public faith has eroded for which we are responsible we will have to remember that if we behave badly the patients would also behave the same way but i still believe that fair number of doctors dont indulge in any corrupt practices with money being such a ruling factor in the modern day corruption has also crept in but it is our fundamental responsibility to ensure fair and honest practice what are regulatory bodies doing to curb this menace regulatory bodies  the state medical council and medical council of india come down harshly on such doctors if doctors indulge in corrupt practices they are likely to lose their license lot of restrictions also have brought in by the medical council of india on pharma companies sponsoring doctors and any violations lead to the loss of license which for a doctor is  a death bell hopefully the mindset of the doctors would also change for good and thus the percentage of unethical practices would also go down is the occurrence of corruption more in the new age doctors when i was growing up during the s and s there was hardly any corruption and it was true to most of the verticals the formative years are very important if you are exposed in seeing people who are indulging in corrupt practices and making lot of money from it and then you might think that is the way to it writes on retail ecommerce fmcg is a digital social media enthusiast loves music

government project planned in the name of the poor or some other elevated public purpose to bring a multitude of scams the number of scams unearthed during the tenure of the late ys rajasekhara reddy ysr when he was andhra pradesh chief minister satyam maytas and various mining and land scams are simply too numerous to ignore but the biggest of them all is still not discussed much in the media in what could be called the motherofallscams at the state level ysrs jalayagnam will surely rank up there along with the gs and coalgates in  ysr launched perhaps the most ambitious water project in the country with the idea of lifting the flood waters of the krishna and godavari rivers to quench the thirst of two crore residents and provide irrigation to  lakh acres of arid and dryland in the state near the empty water reservoir of jawahar nettampadu lift irrigation scheme in the mehboobnagar district in telangana area raman kirpalfirstpost most of the irrigation projects were undertaken in rayalseema and telangana both now part of the vortex of the struggle for separate statehood nearly half rs  crore of the total estimated amount of rs  lakh crore was spent in nine years with precious little to show for it firstpost investigations reveal that much of the money went to the politiciancontractors in the state every law in the land was breached by some or all of the beneficiaries many had no clearances from the forest department others did not have green signals from the environment department or even the central water commission both mandatory for large water projects some did not even have investment clearance the state government broke its own laws and was busy doling out not just contracts but cash to the contract awardees even as most laws were ignored ysrs government was busy raising the number of projects from an initial  to  as many as  companies belonging to the families of eight mps including a union minister and three state mlas cornered many of the dream jalayagnam irrigation projects worth over rs  crore five congress mps union textiles minister kavuru samba siva rao t subbarami reddy rayapati sambasiva rao lagadapati rajagopal and komatireddy rajgopal reddy figure in this list of favoured politiciancontractors but one should not accuse ysr or only allowing his own party mps to feather their nests possibly with the idea of keeping opposition criticism low even tdp mps modugula venugopala reddy nama nageswara rao and cm ramesh were also allegedly favoured the list of favoured politicians includes three congress mlas adala prabhakar reddy komatireddy venkat reddy and former state minister pileru ramachandara reddy ysr launched jalayagnam initially with  irrigation projects over the krishna and the godavari to harness their flood waters but the number of projects kept increasing first to  then  later  and finally to  even the land for these projects had not been acquired but politiciancontractors were hurriedly awarded the projects the reason for the escalation in the number of projects could be related to the fact that most of them were sanctioned without being declared fully feasible there was less flood water available than what the projects required to be viable cag said in its report that some of the projects based on krishna flood waters were technically not viable as the water that can be drawn in  flood days would be far less than the requirement of these projects cag arrived at this conclusion on the basis of the state governments own expert committee report which said the number of flood days on the krishna were only  and that too at only  percent dependability how then did ysr sanction so many dud projects and now look at the projects which may become redundant a few examples the tunnels built near the nagarujuna sagar reservoir in nalgonda district will require  tmc thousand million cubic feet of water but the available water is only  tmc falling short by  tmc the handri neeva sujala sravanthi hnss project needs  tmc of water to draw into reservoirs but the available water is only  tmc falling short of  tmc two projects thus were created when they could not have got more than a third or a fourth of the water they needed this is probably one reason why more projects were sanctioned to cover up for the shortfalls in the earlier ones the increase in projects is widely suspected to be deliberate and done on the sly the andhra pradesh government did not undertake any study or survey nor did it seek mandatory clearance from the central water commission cwc or the forest department the comptroller and auditor general cag in its performance audit report tabled in the andhra pradesh assembly in june  says  projects were taken up without investment clearance  had no forest clearance  had no environmental clearance four were taken up without any feasibility report and  were taken up without consent from the cwc besides technical evaluation was not done before awarding most of these projects to top it all the state government broke its own order go  which had mandated that no company should be given more than three projects but most of the companies backed by mps and mlas bagged more than three projects not only this the state government doled out advance money equivalent to  percent of the total project cost as mobilisation funds thus minister of textile kavuru samba siva raos company progressive constructions got rs  crore as advance immediately after it was awarded a number of projects why should the state pay advances to contractors the state government justifies the offer of mobilisation funds on the ground that this was essential for speedy implementation and argued that it had got back the bulk of the funds this of course is simply not true according to rti documents submitted to the state lokayukta in the form of public complaint a third of the money hasnt come back the state government gave away rs  crore as mobilisation funds but has only recovered rs  crore rs  crore is still with the contractors many of progressive constructions projects for example are stuck for various reasons and it is yet to return rs  crore out of rs  crore received according to a complaint lodged with the state lokayukta the state government however argues that less than rs  crore is pending with contractors and the balance will be recovered in further bills but there is little doubt that tender rules were bent for various contractors as the cag notes the government state gave a shorter time for bidding and took a much longer time for evaluating and accepting the bids which could give scope to postbidding manipulations even if one were to assume that some level of corruption is unavoidable the least one can expect is that the project at least delivers what was promised but jalayagnams delivery is practically very little a few structures pump stations and lift systems have been commissioned under jalayagnam but very little water was lifted to fill the reservoirs the engineering marvel has now turned into a huge monster that has swallowed lots of money  water with little real benefit for a waterstarved region meanwhile the cost estimate for the project has swelled to twice the original size to rs  lakh crore to understand the nexus between politicians and their  interests it is interesting to note how it was all done the modus operandi is to first start a  and once you achieve some success hand the  over to relatives and then get directly into politics political clout then helps the  succeed most of the mpsmlas linked to the jalayagnam projects were once contractors founders and promoters of their respective infrastructure companies when entering parliament or the legislative assembly they step aside and hand over the reins of the  to sons daughters wives and brothers their companies then flourish all these companies seem to have the same profilemotto build dams powerhouses barrages canals roadways waterways tunnels industrial commercial and residential structures as mps and mlas they keep track of infrastructure developments that may be of interest to their family businesses a careful reading of each mps homepage indicates a clear conflict of interest between the questions they ask in the legislature and the businesses their families operate firstpost has written and smsed all mps and mlas for their versions of the story only two mps nama nageswara rao and komtireddy rajgopal reddy got back over the phone to tell us that they would send their replies of the two only nama nageswara rao has spoken to firstpost so far we will be happy to add the version of the rest as and when they respond in the second part of our investigation firstpost will detail who got what in the

individuals life in india centres around the family depending on the values it cherishes our families can be a boon or a bane a blessing or a curse indian families can cut both ways they can stifle an individuals aspirations with a heavy hand especially in the case of women or they can provide them with wings to fly high as in the case of sachin tendulkar deepika padukone or sania mirza as the nation celebrates the genius of the worlds greatest cricketer whos won our hearts in such an extraordinary way lets look closely at the familys role in nurturing supporting and encouraging sachin tendulkar in the pursuit of his talent at the other end of the spectrum are the families run by ironwilled patriarchs who decide practically everything for their children what they will study what will they play which professional courses they will or wont pursue and whom they will marry leaving no choice for the individual the indian youth is crisscrossing the nation in the pursuit of education and employment in larger numbers than ever before this is bound to result in intercultural and interreligious relationships and yet how many indian families are willing to bridge the caste and religious divide to endorse marriages resulting from such relationships sachins family during his speech at wankhede pti in extreme cases many families continue to be dictated by their  councils or khap panchayats who wont hesitate to order the honour killings of young couples in love who may have eloped and married in violation of  norms since other peoples grief is extremely captivating indian television channels uniformly promote serials that project the worst of the family tv serials are all about conflict where suppressing individual aspirations to fulfill the wishes of the elders or preserving and promoting the familys honour and prestige is of paramount importance its official sachin tendulkar to get bharat ratnawith sachin gone cricket will never sound the same againsachins farewell my life between  yards for  years has endedfrom dravid to federer who said what about sachins speechnot a dry eye as sachin bids farewell in a typical indian setting it would have been impossible for a sachin tendulkar to marry a woman six years his senior look around and youll find so many indian families rejecting the choice of a lifepartner made by their grownup children the reasons could be varied the horoscopes dont match the person belongs to a lower caste the person is not good looking has a dark complexion is much shortertaller than hisher partner does not belong to the same  or religion and so oninnumerable relationships of young couples in love have been destroyed with fierce opposition from the family look at the liberal and supportive family environment in which sachin tendulkar was able pursue his talent in cricket and give it his fullest attention his elder brother ajit was the first to spot sachins talent and was instrumental in mentoring him from a tender age when he introduced him to his coach ramakant achrekar on achrekars suggestion sachins father ramesh tendulkar allowed the child to change his school from the indian education societys new english school in bandra east to sharadashram vidyamandir english high school at dadar sachin then moved in to stay with his uncle and aunt who lived at shivaji park to participate in regular coaching strongly mentored by his elder brother ajit who has stood by sachin  a rock throughout his illustrious career sachin has never wavered from his focus on cricket and never allowed himself to get swayed by the trappings of success fame and money even as his entire family scrupulously avoided the limelight tennis star sania mirzas father was the driving influence in her case refusing to buckle to pressure from some sections among muslims who objected to her short tennis attire as unislamic hockey star dhanraj pillay who hailed from a poor family in kirkee pune received considerable support

make us proud but even if you didnt you would not have any regrets that you did not try how many parents are willing to let their children follow their heart and pursue their dreams and ambitions

clear by the selfassertion i am honest and not a part of the sleaze is this seamy side of the organisation an aberration there are different assessments but a realistic view would be what we see is only the tip of the corruption iceberg are appointments and promotions influenced by payments widespread in the railways my experience in the last  years shows that while cases of such warped commerce are not unknown they are not so common as to compromise the system there are bad eggs who sooner or later get caught because of their greed the organised unions also help keep such incidents in check in any case incidents of posts and promotions being bought are certainly not as prevalent in the railways as is suspected in some other organisations then what is this hullabaloo about now if this is just a oneoff incident nip it in the bud and move on unfortunately this alleged ministernephew con has deeper ramifications than meets the eye for one this is the first time that appointments at a top management level have been shown to be manipulateable by payments besides it exposes the lacunae in the system that allows even juniors to aspire for plum postings finally the failure to adhere to set norms and the principle of senioritycumsuitability has opened up the opportunity to show favouritism in promotions it is a fact that appointments of general manager and members of the railway board are generally based on wellestablished rules norms and procedures and cannot be the subject of any bargaining or manoeuvring sometimes the actual places of postings attract criticism because of the ministers choice of officers for specific coveted cities or zonesproduction units but such preferences are highly unlikely to attract financial shenanigans again promotions of railway board members are based on rules for example for posting as member mechanical the seniormost general manager from the mechanical department who has a minimum of one years residual service would normally be the choice in recent times though ministers have in a number of cases preferred a junior officer and pushed through their choice by identifying handicaps and problems with the senior eligible officers in most such cases norms are violated because of the ministers desire to have members he can trust of course such freedom of choice could possibly open the door for corrupt practices as witnessed in the mahesh kumar case a second dimension of this scam is the underlying reality that the railways continues to be a political football for our leaders to play with and exploit for their own and their partys benefit the real reason the railways is not able to live up to its promise is not corruption but the lack of meaningful reforms which requires political will the existing archaic structure of the railways including the railway board is no longer suitable in tackling the transporters challenges of the st century especially the demands of the market place and needs of the customers it is not as if this severe handicap has not been diagnosed in the past and recommendations for drastic overhaul given from the tandon committee  to the rakesh mohan committee  and the pitroda committee  all have recommended major restructuring and changes in management philosophy the existing dispensation however is so dyed in the wool so conservative and resistant to change so terrified that the existing power equations would be upset that all good advice has fallen on deaf ears time after time the opportunity to clean up the system has been ignored every expert body has said the biggest bane of the railways is departmentalism working in silos to manage a dynamic transportation entity removing this one obstacle will add so much synergy to the system that the railways will finally be able to achieve growth in quantum leaps there will be allround improvement in safety and service to customers will such reforms remove or even reduce corruption not likely it would though create an ecosystem that encourages transparency and excellence an environment in which dishonesty will find it hard to prosper systems that allow the immoral nexus between the contractorsupplier and the corrupt officials will need to be nixed despite the bans in place agents operate in the railway ministry with impunity approaching officials in the garb of representing companies or as consultants some among them are not beyond making deals of the kind to which mahesh kumar was allegedly party a strong administration and a strict political leadership can eliminate such misdemeanours easily it is also time both politicians and bureaucrats understood that railway management is a specialised area and a panacea that thrusts generalists to this infrastructure sector may be a cure that is worse

in decisions taken in haste and despite objections from various quarters which caused a loss of revenue to the tune of rs  crores according to bjp leader arun jaitley the attempt to drag in mr vajpayee for causing a rs crore revenue loss while overlooking the direct role of the current pm borders on the absurd speaking to the hindu he said this notion is completely contrary to facts common sense and economic principles a properly recorded dissent will make history while this report will soon be relegated to its rightful place the dustbin the reports tirade against the bjp government and its ministers doesnt stop here devoting nearly  of the  pages to this in chapter  observations and recommendations it makes serious allegations of impropriety undue haste and causing losses against extelecom minister mr arun shourie and exfinance minister jaswant singh both of the bjp vajpayee attacked in section  the report takes its investigation towards the ndaled new telecom policy  and the migration package which moved the telecom industry from licence fee to revenue  regime while replacing the duopoly structure to open competition this occurred when mr vajpayee was the prime minister of the nda government from march  till  across two terms including a month government which lasted till mid heaping criticism over the process the report questions the timing of the migration package it states the committee however takes note of the fact that at the time of approval and implementation of the migration package a care taker government was in place following dissolution of parliament the report states that both the president of india and later the election commission in august  raised concerns over the undue haste in implementing the migration package and its timing the report states that mr vajpayee himself wrote in a letter to the president of india indicating that the policy decision taken in this regard was taken well before the dissolution of parliament and justified its need for its urgent implantation brooking no delay while the report admits that the delhi high court permitted the migration package subject to its approval by the council of ministers and the th lok sabha the report concludes it is evident that the government of the day acted in haste and it would have been wiser on the part of the government to hold back the cabinet decision till the constitution of the new government the draft report then goes on to calculate losses and revenue foregone to state that the nda government had foregone revenue to the tune of rs  crores in the course of offering the migration package of ntp  shourie favoured corporates the report then turns its guns on arun shourie regarding the implementation of the firstcomefirstserved policy and grant of new uas licences in  two decisions that were made by mr shourie as the then telecom minister slamming mr shouries decision the report says the committee are however concerned to point out that the decision to adopt firstcomefirstserved criteria for issue of uas licences was taken in undue haste and was not based on comprehensive deliberation that merited issue in question the committee also accuses the dot and mr shouries telecom secretary vinod vaish for acting in an opaque manner by holding them at fault for not publishing the adopted procedure which is against the canon of fairness and transparency while implementing the uasl regime many of the decisions under attack in the report were approved by mr shourie the hindu was unable to reach mr shourie for his  despite multiple attempts jaswant singh caused loss the report does not spare a member of the jpc jaswant singh who was the finance minister in the nda government from april  till may  also stands accused as his ministry according to the report working with the dot and contrary to the cabinet decision of october  that found no case to give a compensation package to cellular operators based on the perception that their finances were strained reduced the licence fee the report calculates the loss to the exchequer by such an action of the finance ministry at rs  crore for the first  years and rs  crore per

didyouknow all you need to know about the new rs  notes oct    ist bal thackeray dussehra rally manohar joshi mumbai politics politicsdecoder shiv sena uddhav thackeray by abhay vaidya at age  shiv senas senior leader manohar joshi has enjoyed the fruits of senas power more than any other functionary in the party as a trusted lieutenant of the senas founder the late bal thackeray he was richly rewarded at every stage of the senas elevation in politics right through the early s joshi was one of shiv senas earliest mayors of bombay  and maharashtras first noncongress chief minister when the sena with its alliance partner the bjp rode to power in maharashtra in  even after he was forced to step down as chief minister in  in the wake of court strictures against him for favouring his builder soninlaw in the sun dew apartments scam in pune joshi occupied ministerial berths in delhi and had also graced the speakers chair in the lok sabha he saw that as an opportunity to go even higher as a vicepresidential nominee manohar joshi during the shiv sena rally on sunday pti all that stood reduced to dust with the ignominious manner in which joshi was booed off the stage by common shiv sainiks at the partys mostimportant annual gathering the dussehra rally at mumbais shivaji park grounds on  october humiliated off the stage joshi left the venue promptly when accosted by journalists for a reaction the former maharashtra chief minister was ashenfaced but guarded in his  whatever has happened is the result of a misunderstanding was how he put it without wanting to be dragged further into the controversy as with the sun dew apartments case when he brought misery upon himself by manipulating the public reservation status of a municipal school in pune to favour his builder soninlaw in the present situation too joshi invited the crisis upon himself the trouble began last month when joshi met the party president uddhav thackeray to stake claim to the mumbai southcentral lok sabha seat from where he had won in  but lost in  amidst clear indications that the party was favouring a younger aspirant for that seat rahul shewale standing committee chairman of the brihanmumbai municipal corporation joshi sought clarifications from uddhav after the meeting he told reporters that he was even willing to contest from thane or kalyan as an alternative to his home constituency ever the diplomat who always described his meetings with uddhav as cordial joshi sparked another controversy when he obliquely criticised uddhav during a public speech in mumbai last week for not being aggressive enough in demanding a memorial for bal thackeray at shivaji park dadar had the late bal thackeray faced such an issue over a memorial for his father said joshi he would have brought the government down joshi precipitated matters further by openly confabulating with ncp president sharad pawar suggesting that he was exploring options other than the shiv sena it was now only natural that this heavyweight of the past would be seen as weakening the party and attract the ire of the sena rank and file on the ground thus little time was lost in booing him off the stage at shivaji park if the bjp could silence a stalwart  lk advani for coming in the way of narendra modis elevation as the partys prime ministerial candidate certainly manohar joshi couldnt have expected any less joshis biggest folly was his eagerness to perpetuate his political relevance in the shiv sena by demanding the assurance of a parliamentary seat this bid for personal power was all the more illtimed because of the challenging times in which the shiv sena finds itself one year after bal thackerays death uddhav has been trying hard to consolidate his position in the party hold the flock together and effectively face the challenge of the  state and general elections that will serve as a test of his leadership uddhav is blessed with neither the aggressive posturing nor the oratorical skills of his father or cousin raj thackeray bereft of its own distinctive agenda for the  polls the shiv sena is hopeful that narendra modi will rescue the party in the general elections and an antiincumbency wave will help their cause in the state polls that are also slated for next year rather than pushing for a ticket for himself after having enjoyed all the top positions in previous decades manohar joshi should have applied his age and experience to strengthen uddhavs hand and the future of the sena an avuncular role in guiding the party and the younger generation of the sena was expected of him not a narrow selfseeking agenda in the eyes of the sena rank and file joshi exposed himself as a smallminded selfseeking politician who did not value all the rewards that the party bestowed on him and inevitably little time was lost in putting him in place manohar gajanan joshis political journey has all but lost its direction first published on oct    ist afghanistan in united

to discuss issues such as corruption in government establishments failure of the system at all levels deprivation of the poor and needy etc said prism president vanlalruata initially he said prism was entirely dependent on the rti in their crusade against corruption but soon it hit upon the unique idea of eiru thlan bawm which is a kind of secret public balloting to zero in on the corrupt vanlalruata explained its very simple prism encourages people to write the names of individuals who they believe are corrupt with specific charges papers containing the names are then dropped inside eiru bawm corruption ballot box installed in aizawl when the boxes are opened at a public meeting charges against the individuals are scrutinised for veracity and processed for filing of fir alongside the rti is used to extract more information about those named by people as corrupt corruption is a serious problem in mizoram nothing impedes development  corruption we believe the eiru thlan bawm model would help curb the menace significantly said vanlalruata prism does everything possible to help people get justice and basic human rights at the various seminars which it organises people are made aware of their rights as a result today they are not afraid of raising their voice against injustice what inspires us most is to see people starting to believe that even the mighty and

stones or slippers irrespective of their rank and authority the average policeman becomes the symbol of all the ills of the judicial system caught in the middle the indian police often personifies the worst of the indian justice system reuters but a closer look at the police force as an institution reveals that a policeman is a product of a system that incentivises the worst practices nonregistration of firs indifferent attitude towards lower income groups illegal detentions and custodial deaths one problem with the policemen in this country is that there simply arent enough of them vacancies in police forces reveal a force that is overworked and undermanned bureau of police research development data shows that as on  the total national strength of police force armed and civil was  lakh less than the sanctioned strength chandigarh has the maximum number of policemen available per  sq kms also known as the police area ratio followed by delhi and lakshadweep and yet in terms of absolute numbers delhi is  members short of the required strength increasing the number of police personnel however will achieve little in the absence of training said v n rai former director national police academy police is the only government entity in the country after defence which has been recruiting growing number of young people for past  years but they dont get converted into a human resource he said citing the example of delhi gangrape rai said we saw how delhi police wasted crucial time infighting over jurisdiction which might have lead to victims death after that incident has delhi police trained its staff to be more sensitive towards people no a big part of the training is still devoted to lathi charge and dealing with abnormal situations bad training makes for bad cops more so when they enter the force with bad attitudes male cops often blame women for inviting rape and shun complainants from dalit  because of biases and prejudices they bring with them when they join the police force ideally they should be constitutionally conditioned during their training they should be  a clean slate before they are deputed at police stations said rai if training does little to change their attitudes experiences in the job can often corrupt the best the organisational culture within the police force favours the corrupt and often corrupts the honest organizational culture works at three levels said js pandey former director general of police uttarakhand individual systemic and peer they reinforce each other police subculture itself gets reinforced by systemic pressures that we put on policemen in general dealing with too much pressure to produce results reuters cops at gandhi nagar police station might have refused to register the fir in the case of rape of the fiveyearold because  policemen across the country they too want to fudge the crime figures lower the crime rate at a than better the performance rating of its officers the pressure to get results also leads to a host of other illegal police behavior how do they deal with them they find the suspect put him through psychological pressure torture him and try to work out the case somewhat similar is the strategy for crime control police officers believe that whoever has been arrested cannot leave the police station without getting limbs broken police wants to create this fear even honest officers even ips officers who have never indulged in torture start indulging in torture and all illegalities says pandey who argues that the organizational culture cannot be changed unless we change the way we assess police performance according to pandey the performance of police personnel should be judged not by the number of reported crimes but by their response to crime in the delhi gangrape case they allegedly wasted crucial time arguing over jurisdiction in aarushi case police could not locate the body of the servant hemraj which was lying on the rooftop these are factors which speak volumes about the quality of probe and should be taken into consideration while assessing police performance he says in a national conference on police reforms conducted in march  by

got the most honest civil service it is number one in  peace index number of crimes registered is  per lakh population in india it is  per lakh population it is ironic that the refusal to register an fir in order to maintain the appearance of police efficiency has instead helped further destroy their credibility the fbi arrested suspect in boston bombing delhi police arrested the accused in rape of the fiveyearold while the us citizens applauded their police force for prompt action delhi police got flak thats because initially delhi police refused to register fir said p s bawa ips rtd and

is just as mysterious the best anyone knows the united jihad council doesnt have management consultants its even odder that this meeting took place on september  as the military intelligence report claims manmohan singh only announced his plans to meet with nawaz sharif on september so this would mean a midranking isi official had a weeks advance notice of the plans of indias prime minister the text c at the bottom of the document gives some of the tale away in the grading system used at the intelligence bureaurun multi agency centre or mac the central clearing house for the intelligence services this means the source who came up with the tale wasnt high up in the credibility stakes yep the ace spies took a tale from a petty informantand then linked up the coolaid for public consumption illinformed television hacks lapped up the lassi as delhi boys would put it the important takeaway here though isnt that its easy to make monkeys of journalists which it undoubtedly is the document itself is genuine so you cant blame reporters for carrying it it was highlyplaced government sources told firstpost prepared by the military intelligence directorate for a meeting of mac and then recirculated on  october it is identical in its structure to a mac document except in the identification tag firstpost is withholding the correct format of mac identification tags for obvious reasons it boggles the imagination though that the army would actually want to leak this awful demonstration of the complete incompetence of its intelligence corps rather than be yelling out the clearly illtrained and incompetent junior officer for being suckered by an informant for what its worth my guess is that the gentlemen concernedwho journalistic convention regrettably forbids me from namingthought the leak would deflect attention from another ongoing embarassment this morning newspapers carried fresh revelations on the armys keran fiascoeven failing to retrieve lost observation posts while announcing to the media that that it had woundup operations the story broken by firstpost came at the end of a series of incidents that suggested thoroughgoing command incompetence ranging from attacks on troops in srinagar which went on for an hour before anyone responded to beheadings of sleeping soldiers on the line of control and of course the ease with which terrorists hit samba its also possible the leak was meant to let the political executive off the hook for its continued engagement with pakistan after all the military intelligence document says the isi tried to restrain

being passed will keep politicians in check students of the mumbaibased s p jain institute of management research respond finally after a few decades and huge civil protest a crippled government perhaps one with the most number of scams and corrupt ministers has passed a bill which will put them in jail the lokpal bill is structurally weak and just another law with grey areas which will lead to indecision and confusion it neither provides whistleblowers protection nor independence to the cbi cbi will thus have another master to serve in the form of the lokpal committee creating divided loyalty it is being passed at the juncture of landslide defeats of the ruling party across four states and just before the lok sabha election next year it is very likely to be an eyewash to regain political ground and establish an image of transparency we need all the complementary bills that is the whistleblowers protection bill and citizens grievance redress bill along with the necessary political electoral and infrastructural reform to create a real strong weapon against corruption atanu biswas the masses have accepted and applauded the passage of the lokpal and lokayukta bill  it has restored confidence in the indian political system the bill has all categories of government officials under its purview and aims to address certain basic but highly critical pain points of todays political and legal system the indian legal system has been plagued by delays and is a major reason for the brazenness and large scale of corruption cases the bill addresses this issue by making the inquiry investigation and trial processes timebound lately cbi indias foremost investigating agency has been under attack for being controlled by the ruling government the bill includes a number of amendments to strengthen cbi and increase its autonomy moreover at present the investigating agencies need the governments sanction to prosecute wrongdoers which makes it difficult to get sanctions for important positions the shift in power of sanction is expected to speed up the process and increase the credibility of the agencies the bill holds great promises to curb corruption but its eventual impact will depend on contingent groundlevel implementation anuradha kumari the lokpal and lokayukta bill  misses out on providing safety to the whistleblowers not only that if the complaint is found to be false then such whistleblower could be imprisoned too now we all know that a normal person  you and me can just provide information to the authorities and it would not be always possible to have evidence this puts an ordinary citizen in the position where he would not want to jeopardise his situation to turn in a corrupt officer or a politician even countries such as ghana south korea and uganda have whistleblower protection a politician who is synonymous with power and influence can use his resources to distort facts gyayak jain after its first draft in  it took  years for the lokpal bill to be eventually passed on december  although a step in the right direction i am still very pessimistic about whether it will be able to hold politicians accountable i feel this was done more as a desperate measure as a response to the success of the aam aadmi party in the delhi elections i am not very optimistic that this lokpal bill will really change anything although i do hope that i am proved wrong aditya jain the optimist in me believes that the passage of this legislation is a step in the right direction towards curtailing institutional corruption especially at the higher rungs the realist in me however thinks otherwise the willor lack thereof of state governments to implement this law an inadequate legal infrastructure and the rules governing the selection of the lokpal members all raise serious concerns the demands for a robust jan lokpal bill were a manifestation of peoples anguish and trust deficit over rampant corruption among the political class of the country but the composition of the selection committee which now includes three politicians as opposed to the earlier draft and the strict penalties over wrongful claims will deter public participation additionally not bringing the legislative wing of the state under the bills ambit restricts the scope and transparency of the law  with any policy of this nature the devil is in the detail only time will tell if this law succeeds in addressing corruption among politicians till then lets suffice to say that the lokpal is not a magic wand namrata suri it is slightly unreasonable to expect a nation of over a billion people to construct a polity that is free from all sorts of malfeasance more so in a country that has glaring inequalities at multiple levels but its also difficult to ignore the possibility that sometimes people can collectively desire an outcome that has the potential of inducing an entirely new meaning to the existing form of governance for a variety of reasons such as corruption being extremely pervasive and endemic especially amongst politicians the lokpal bill may not be the best option it may be far from perfect but perfection would be too much to expect from an idea that is almost unprecedented but promising nonetheless honestly i havent seen cynicism take us very far so i am hoping that this one time faith just might singdha khurana as diverse as our country is so are our laws public servants and politicians can be penalised through a variety of laws  the prevention of corruption act and the money laundering act the intent and vision of the lokpal bill is noble laudable and promising but can one law alone keep our politicians in check as a management student i would  to look at this from a different perspective any law is an investment an investment which needs capital and labour the jan lokpallokpal bill has been doing the rounds in parliament for decades and the total estimated budget is half of the home ministrys budgeted plan expenditure as of  when it comes to labour requirements the central vigilance commission is critically understaffed to manage the sheer volume of corruption cases the implementation of the law will help check monetary corruption but moral corruption is a force that no national law can eradicate a single law cannot eliminate our politicians venality the fight against corruption involves changing mindsets attitudes vision and more importantly a constant adherence to the words of the oaths they take when elected sumesh nair whether or not it will work we want to believe it will because sitting at a distance that seems the most convenient thing to do the lokpal bill may empower an independent body to take action against corrupt politicians which may make a politician think twice before heshe commits a corrupt act but as long as we continue to vote or support them in one way or other a corrupt politician will always have the licence to do whatever heshe wishes to the solution then will be completely viable only when we make ourselves aware and responsible enough to not support someone who has indulged in corrupt acts the intended result will be seen only when we respond by not voting for them in elections when we ensure they are punished in the court of law when we ensure that they are ashamed enough to not even think of something corrupt ever again the lokpal bill is merely a tool its real power will come into effect when we as citizens ensure that every politician keeps a check on himself his thoughts and deeds with fear in his mind a healthy fear of the public not necessarily the lokpal prakhar jain"},{"Date":"25 Dec 2013","Link":"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ganta-likely-to-return-to-tdp/article5501888.ece","text":"the

making money in administration onus for decisions such as purchasing copters should vest in an individual long years ago i was advised by an elderly gentleman who was travelling with me on the grand trunk express never to take a decision on my own involve as many others as possible only then will i have several people to back me up when anything goes wrong as it will i am afraid i did not accept his advice some months later the accounts department pointed out an error in my decision and i wrote on the file i am sorry my head of the department ahmad and a very nice gentleman was furious he said never accept a mistake there are millions and millions of notings in government files there must be any number of mistakes in them however i doubt whether there is one noting which says i am sorry i committed a mistake god may commit mistakes but no government official does so also nobody is guilty unless proven without doubt as there is virtually in every case some doubt or other ipso facto nobody is guilty after one of his experiments went horribly wrong gandhiji said i have committed a himalayan blunder our leaders never follow mahatma gandhi they prefer ahmads principle that is a pity we also do not forgive i wish we could develop a culture of charity treat mistakes as mere faults only when they are hidden and not accepted treat them as a crime in the us an accused can even make what is called a plea bargain accept a smaller offence than he is charged with why should we not have a similar system in our country acts of corruption are tumbling out of the closet these days naturally the opposition is making the most of the situation unfortunately there is not one political party that does not have skeletons in its cupboard the opposition parties forget that when they come to power as in a democracy they will someday they themselves will be harassed the way the government is being harassed today further nobody takes or initiates steps that will reduce mistakes or discover them early before they cause serious harm in particular no one is talking of what should be done to tackle the excuses the culprits give for their maladministration corruption will continue and will probably increase and not decrease unless and until the excuses are checked and the political system is reformed suppose the recent helicopter purchase had been entrusted to just one senior official with full authority to use his personal discretion to decide after consulting all relevant officials however he cannot request any special provisions to suit the whims of his bosses further absolutely no middlemen or any price negotiation either the official may be given the authority to reject even the lowest quotation if a better system was considered worth the higher price then the purchase would take months and not years cost will be less if there is a whiff of corruption one and only one person will be responsible however in such a system no politician can make money hence i repeat our legislators even the runnersup should be paid very well further all legitimate election expenses of serious candidates should be met in full by the state what those expenses are should be decided in consultation with candidates in each constituency also political parties should be made internally democratic the way they are in developed countries the high commands will not select candidates for any election but decide party policy only in addition administration should be decentralised our administrators are under the false impression that power resides in overseeing every petty decision actually all organisations require three kinds of operators one policymakers who decide what should be done two technicians who decide what tasks have to be performed and also perform them three inspectors who find out where things went wrong and where they were done well policymakers should be wise well informed of historical precedents and of future technological prospects the actors should be highly skilled in their respective trades inspectors should be critical but not nitpickers they should be charitable and forgive simple errors no one person can be proficient in all three tasks and the system should select appropriate persons in each case handsomely reward good performance and correct bad ones in their early days the iits were quite well run once a year the top finance official of the education ministry would go to each iit and decide through consultation how much funds each one will get then each iit could decide how the money should be spent it did not have to take permission on each purchase or expenditure the auditor general inspected the accounts every year permitting much autonomy in decisionmaking further every few years the iits were reviewed by a joint expert committee which recommended new directions under which each iit could proceed it worked well we need such a system throughout the country and in every department unfortunately these days senior officials of the ministry sit on the boards of the iits and all other socalled autonomous institutions they destroy autonomy by talking of what the minister desires further the judiciary should resolve promptly complaints about the legality of its actions unfortunately with the abolition of the jury system trials take years and years giving criminals a life time to get away there is an urgent need to remove the power of adjourning trial cases from the judiciary make each trial court a fasttrack one how i wish that our leaders are paid well they learn to accept and forgive errors administration is decentralised and the judges punish quickly those who hide their errors the author is a former director iit madras response to indiresangmailcom this is th in the vision  series the previous article appeared on february  this is an excellent article and has enough inputs how to minimise corruptionbut this comes afterwhat we need to do is beforemr indiresan is known to be honestupright and knowledgeable if things need to change i am of firm opinion that the dubious first family which has swindled lot of money is first caughttheir wealth confiscated and sent to tiharsimilarly the regional satraps in every state who have dipped their fingers and merrily grabbed as much as they can are also caught and punishedwithout the fear of punishment whatever indiresan writes has no valueas a final thought during indiresans tenure at iitmadras he must check with colleagues in the know how free of corruption his institute wasit will be an eye opener for himpreaching is easyas they say money doesnt  love so money just doesnt  honestythere has to be a big element of stick wielded by a neutral body which will keep the crooks away from the honey pot as always prof indiresan analyzed the problem systematically and try to provide intellectual solution however he missed some points  even in todays decision making may be with multiple levels there is supposed to be accountability the committee chairman is expected to own the decision unforunately there is no ownership or no one expect them to take ownership  if only individual takes decision still the corruption issue will be there since it is not easy for honest people to reach those decision taking positions mostly those persons reaches this position are not competent or obliged to do some favour who nominated to these positions  what requires to reduce eliminate the corruption is make the system transparent those who are in the top infact they are all well paid even now needs to think of country and the poor tax payer money and loyal to the country we need sincere faithful people in the top who makes decision systemic problems need systemic treatments the solutions suggested here are localized and not systemic what is corruption it is a form of exploitation by use of ones authority power and position which is built into the psyche of all that exists systemic solutions to major evils  terrorism and large scale corruption should come from fundamental transformation in the psyche through universalvalue based education from formative years instead of education being narrowed to maximizing earning potential another additional systemic solution to tackle corruption is through reforms in the political system in which the role of elected leaders is limited to lawmaking while administration including selling of national resources and purchases are left to independently constituted by upsc type professional bodies their transparent functioning and through strengthening the judicial system for prompt intervention and quick remedies for any wrong doings in these areas corruption in my opinion is a complicated subject the person who think he is not corrupt may be the most corrupt the definition of the word is not probably not understood secondly in india we see lot of people fighting over the spilt milk and dont think of ways not to spill it again it is high time that india think in terms of  than charity from the leaders and bureaucrats you have to be a saint to be charitable and it is useless to have a saint to run a country we need people who can deliver the goods than preachers or the onlookers will go with the catch no lengthy commend is needed for all this take the quote of kunjannambiar of kerala who said deepasthampam maha aschariam namakum kittanam panam it is time we should  our constitution and election system that have been now outdated and become redundant see how usa legislated for only two terms for the president while in india ministers numbering  in delhi are elected who look their constituencies to get reelected and make administrators working under them scapegoats whereas in usa secretariescounterpart of ministers in india are less than  and never elected who run the government independently congress representing senate members and house of representatives are concerned with only policy making and legislation government has to implement policies strictly without fear and favor in germany election expenses are funded by the government two topmost personalities chancellor and president had to resign immediately when alleged for mobilizing money privately for electionand the party mobilizing less than  votes cannot be represented in parliament we must study theese and adapt to suit to us i do not agree that the politicians should be paid well so that they stay away from making money in administration politicians will continue to make illegal money unless the fundamental cause is understood and tackled as long as we have fertile field of  activities in which government has no reason to be in the corruption will continue to be endemic adam smith famously affirmed the basic human nature saying it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest humans by nature is self serving which enables butcher brewer or baker to make a living and incidentally serve the society it is true of politicians also who when they are elected will not be transformed in to moral saint and will favor interest groups that supported him or follow the policies that may lead to reelection hence only way to reduce the corrupt practices should be to remove government hand from nonstrategic  activities  running air lines bus services making soaps and detergents etc and leave them to the selfcorrecting genius of individual entrepreneurs reduce the government foot print to a maximum extent from  activities there will be marked reduction in corruption the craze for money is insatiable in certain cases the goons smugglers bootleggers financially support the candidate who become prisoners morally to these and make all out efforts to support argue and even indulge in criminal acts as mark of gratitude government offices are still citadels of corruption since middle men negotiate for every dealing high cost of higher education accustomed to living in convenient form of life style etc demand more money than what the salary gives even though the ministersmps are well paid we see them indulging in flexing the rules violating them threatening the officers etc in award of licenses for telecom coal block allocation and a host of others honesty must start from mrno it is not enough if he alone is honesthe must have the courage to question admonish take punitive measures against the erring cabinet colleaguesthe present problem is that the present mr no is not such is this the last article of mr pvindiresan if so

to saturdays carnage will be picked apart either the  millionplus israelimade heron longrange surveillance drones flown across the region each day failed to pick up the gathering of an ambush team reported to be hundreds strongor the national technical reconnaissance organisation didnt interpret the imaging data accurately the chhattisgarh police will have to explain why its intelligence networks in sukma missed the gathering of the assault team and so will the intelligence bureau there will be questions too about why a road being used by several highprofile politicians wasnt more effectively swept for minesand why more central reserve police force units werent combing the darba plateau the maoists battlefield of choice flanked to the north by the dense kanger forests and to the east by the balimela jungles it isnt the first time these questions have been askedand we can be sure that the answers well get will be lies it hasnt been six months after all since chhattisgarh directorgeneral of police ramniwas proclaimed that the states maoist problem was very much under control ever since april intelligence agencies had been warning that maoists would focus on highprofile but vulnerable targets in the premonsoon periodthe traditional time for whats called the tcoc or tactical counteroffensive in  a tcoctime attack had claimed the lives of a staggering  crpf personnel at tarmetla the worst single loss india has ever suffered in counterinsurgency in the years since though the crpf has pushed up its deployment in chhattisgarh to over  battalionsand more important grasped the fundamentals of jungle warfare for months therefore maoists had been unable to mount the kinds of largescale attacks on security forces that had made them feared earlier this month maoists killed three police officers in an attack on the all india radio station near jagdalpur but failed to overwhelm their target what seemed to be an irresistible tide of violence had been fought to a stalemateand the maoists commanders knew they needed to do something spectacular to project power in spite of the warnings both the state and central governments remained sanguine  the rest of india chhattisgarh had registered a decline in levels of maoist violence in  according to the union ministry of home affairs  civilians  security force personnel and and  maoists were killed in down from  civilians  police personnel and  maoists in  this was however a fundamental misrepresentation of the situation fire engagement with police declined sharply from  to  even while the number of attacks on them rose from  to  intelligence services reported  military training camps had been held in  the same as in  the number of reported jan adalatsmaoist courts often characterised by savage punishments for alleged informers and ideological enemiesactually rose from  to  even though there was fewer killing thus the maoist presence on the ground hadnt diminished significantly put simply the data showed the police had backed off offensive operations retreating into holding defensive positions hardened against attack lacking political support for the collateral damage that accompanies all counterinsurgency operationslast year orders were issued to call off operations rather than risk civilian casualties they simply bunkered down the leadership called this retreat victory it isnt the first time that fantasy has passed for policy in  as the union government mobilised crpf personnel for its first push into the maoist heartland union home secretary gk pillai promised that within  days of the security forces moving in and dominating the area we should be able to restore civil administration eleven weeks after the massacre of crpf personnel at tarmetla p chidambaram announced he was confident that the problem of left wing extremism will be overcome in the next three years in  maoist violence peaked the union home ministry claimed its actions had led to much better results the united progressive alliances policies drew on populationcentric warfare doctrines then fashionable in the pentagon it thought embedding the security forces amidst the population could spearhead a developmental pushand bring peace experts on indian insurgencies warned this wouldnt work ajai sahni sardonically suggested that the government restore civil administration to vast expanses of rural india where the maoists have no presence whatsoever but where virtually the entire apparatus of governance has vanished at least some of these areas he noted are little more than a stones throw away from delhi the upa didnt listenand eventually learned the hard way just as the pentagon did in afghanistan even now though the real work of counterinsurgency capacitybuilding hasnt begun in  chhattisgarh had sanctioned positions for  police officers patrol its  sq km of brutal terrain illconnected by roadcontrast that with  in gujarat about the same size or  with delhi the number sanctioned in  when the maoist insurgency was just gathering ground was  of which just  were actually in service the worst deficits are at critical midlevel command positions chhattisgarh needs  officers from the rank of deputy superintendent of police to senior superintendent of police but has just  for all the talk the figures show theres no coherent strategy for forcebuilding the less thats said about training and skills enhancement the better chhattisgarh founded a school of jungle warfare with great fanfare but the bulk of its recruits are deployed in personalprotection duties for vips it isnt a theoretical debate people are being killed every single day because indian democracy isnt being serious about defending itself against those seeking to overthrow it perhaps its doomed to stay this way  every other crisis to do with national security the debate will soon degenerate into a war of hashtags a competition of mindless namecalling involving feku and pappu large elements of indias élite dont have the stomach for a long and dirty warwhich is what all insurgencies involve for years theres been a complicity with the killingon the left because of misplaced guilt over indias hideous failures to ensure equity for citizens on the right because of the misguided belief that geographical distance allows for apathy its been facilitated by the fact that police officers lives are cheap because the local dalam commander can be bribed to let mines and factories run and because maoists arentyetsetting off bombs in our cities thats why after every previous massacre once we were done with bleating calls for dialogue and bombast about carpetbombing everything went back to the way it was except this time it cant karma explained three years ago the irreducible ideological contest that underpins indias struggle against the maoists i am a democrat he said and live in a democratic system if they are against our system then it is a rebellion and should be crushed  one the biggest drawback of our democracy is that democrats dont have a commitment to their democracy this hasnt always been true in  after maoists almost succeeded in killing n chandrababu naidu andhra pradesh roused itself to decimate terrorism it happened in tripura and in punjab it can be done indias war against the maoists will begin to be won when we decide that the

why the traditional model of ngoled development must end i argued that ngos must cede the space for providing services to panchayati raj institutions pris already most of the governments flagship schemes have roles for gram panchayatsto either manage funds or manage the implementation processes determining the selection of beneficiaries or overseeing physical delivery clearly this is a lot to expect from the pris and one reaction i get very often to all of this is that we are placing too much faith on them that pris are bound to fail under the burden of such expectations however i argue that there is no reason to be fatalistic about pris no doubt pris are crippled by lack of funds and staff but often critics wouldnt even allow the debate to get that far criticizing the very allocation of function funds and staff to pris in this column i will look at some of the most popular reasons why pris are said to be bound to fail and attempt to explain why we need to look beyond these fears  pris are corrupt you hear this all the timefrom the middleclass armchair intellectual to government babus offices ever since mgnrega the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act brought a flood of resources to gram panchayats these allegations have gained in strength there is of course some truth to this but this is akin to claiming that the government should not implement any programmes because politicians and bureaucrats are corrupt what is important to note is that through mechanisms such as social audits locallevel corruption is easy to uncover and transparency has proven to be a powerful tool in the hands of communities the society for social audit accountability and transparency in andhra pradesh the public affairs centre in bangalore the mazdoor kisan shakti sangathan in rajasthan and the  have registered significant successes in improving grassrootslevel transparency and accountability there is also evidence showing that corruption is less in cases where pris are responsible for raising their own resources along with being an agency for the central and state governments to spend their funds ghazala and rao  this calls for an expansion in the role of pris and not a lesser one  pris are dominated by the local elites and are therefore not accountable to the people gram panchayats are often headed by such people much in the same way as our mps and mlas are usually the rich and powerful the competing pressures of politics and the prospect of reelections is a strong accountability measure that can reduce the chances of elite capture pri elections usually see very high turnoutssee recent polls in orrisa and jammu and kashmir a related allegation is that elected women representatives are merely rubber stamps their husbands or other family members are the ones actually running the show researchers have shown how even in gram panchayats where women have come to power on a reserved seat the perceptions among people regarding womens suitability for a political leadership role has shown a distinct change  pris do not know planning their plans are wish lists this is an accusation mostly made in a scenario where state governments do little to train elected pri representatives in their roles and responsibilities pris are burdened with not only responsibilities of needs assessment and resource planning but also monitoring the implementation of a whole range of government schemes in the absence of systematic training in the mechanisms of local resource appraisal it is likely that plans will look more  wishlists in states that have sincerely implemented decentralization reforms technical support groups exist that help pris structure their needs assessments into actionable plans that can be forwarded to the next level  not all development projects can be planned at the gram panchayat level this is a classic misconception gram panchayatlevel plans are supposed to be merged to create a blocklevel plan which in turn form part of a districtlevel plan the typical error committed here is that when one thinks of pris they only think of villagelevel pristhe gram panchayats the fact is it is the two tiers abovethe block panchayat and the zila panchayat which make this a strong federated structurethat are supposed to act as a union of pris that make decisions keeping in mind the priorities on the ground however the planning roles of the zila panchayat and the district planning committee have suffered from years of neglect by the government bureaucracy the points made above are not intended as justifications for the weaknesses of pris instead they point to areas where the state and central governments need to focus in terms of building capacity and support instead of allowing an atmosphere of pessimism to fester around the efficacy of pris once these capability bottlenecks are removed we would be in a better position to have a rational debate regarding the implementation capacity of pris in india "},{"Date":"6 May

showed leading stateowned banks life insurance corporation and private insurers being party to the racket although the rbi has announced action both at the systemic level and at the individual bank level one can only hope they are not cosmetic and the latest expose would spur both the rbi and the irda to address the malaise for all times to come says the cobrapost release however looking at the rbis rather suspicious protectorinsteadofregulator conduct it looks highly unlikely that any worthwhile cleansing of the system will happen we are sure the rbi top brass will again go about town touting the expose as something of a nonissue since no transaction of cash has taken place the release said offering help to launder money is also punishable says bahal aniruddha bahal also drew attention to clauses in the indian penal code ipc and prevention of money laundering act pmla which say that offering to support an offence even if that is not committed is also punishable by law in march this year after the money laundering expose on axis bank hdfc bank and icici bank deputy rbi governor kc chakrabarty had been quoted as saying that allegations do not mean flouting norms and

ousted him from officethe judges pressured ashraf as well and the government finally agreed to the courts demand to ask the swiss to pursue the case which swiss authorities have said privately they

that he can never shed his communal image thanks to godhra and much more this is why he is taking desperate measures including trying to usurp the secular sardar patel well the unfortunate thing for modi is that the  knows too well about what patel thought of the rss he even banned it and held it responsible for mahatma gandhis murder what the  may not know is that patel practiced law in godhra for several years how ironical that the man tarnished by godhra is trying to usurp the one who practiced in that same town unfortunately for modi in todays connected  his sham is visible a mile away ap but the sham is not new it has been going on for some time now as modi has tried to acquire a more secular or at least less communal image first he stopped talking of ayodhya leaving the dirty job to his trusted deputy amit shah instead then he went on to say that toilets came before temples so what if he was copying jairam ramesh then he invited muslims to attend his meetings even doling out burqas and skull caps so what if he didnt wear one himself and now he is willing no make that desperate to even fete the man who couldnt tolerate the rss give him some more time and modi may even be willing to get himself branded mian modi if only all this could make him somehow oh ram please somehow make him the pm lets be clear patel had extreme dislike for the rss he actually banned it in  here are some statements made by him in letters which are freely available on mahatma gandhis murder there is no doubt in my mind the extreme section of the hindu mahasbha was involved in this conspiracy on the rss the activities of the rss constituted a clear threat to the existence of the government and the state his famous poison statement the speeches of the sangh leaders are poisonous it is as a result of this venom that mahatma gandhi has been assassinated and shockingly again the followers of the sangh have celebrated gandhijis assassination by distributing sweets and then speaking in the lok sabha in august  you must remember that when the father of the nation was murdered it was by a group of people who belonged to that organisation hindu mahasabha i am ready to prove to anybody that there was a group of people there who were determined to take his life that aside patels views on communal politics were well known so where does that leave the rss patel was the bête noire of the rss and here modi is trying to embrace him we know modi is a clever politician and as a true politician he doesnt mind doing anything that gets him the moolah in this case the pms chair he knows the rss is a liability and he is keen to dispense with it the congress is already making  a fight between itself and the rss but at the same time he also knows that he is nobody without the rss he has to keep the rss in good humor the question is just how far he can push it a little too far and he could end up  advani when he praised jinnah in an ideal  modi would  to make the rss an accomplice in his fake secular strategy ideally he would  to become the statesman rising above communal politics a la vajpayee while the rss and its sister organizations should continue with their own usual activities this way modi could secure all the votes those of the extremes and the secular others unfortunately the rss is not taking to this very kindly somebody in the know told me that modis single minded focus to become pm even if that means adopting the pet peeves of the rss is upsetting it to no end the rss realizes that its very raison detre that of having a hindu rashtra is being played in the game by modi how could the rss tolerate patel being feted has anyone noticed that the rss has kept a stony silence on this matter patel was a beacon of secularismhow can the rss come to terms with him remember golwalkar one of the sarsanghchalaks of the rss had famously said that the biggest threat india faced was from muslims the second was christians in a way modi is cocking a snook at the rss the rss knows it has been relegated way below modi himself to a distant second position it doesnt  modis i me myself style one bit what should it do play along or call it all off for now it appears the rss may be willing to play along for it realizes there is no other leader in the bjp who can take it to power once the party comes to power if it does they can always decide who to make pm the same person in the know also said that most bjp leaders were also opposed to modi but since the partys cadre was in favor of modi maybe because they were disillusioned with all the others they had no option but to publicly back him but if the rss were to just indicate a little doubt about modi these leaders will be out with their barelyconcealed knives drawn advani sushma murli manohar joshi yashwant sinha will do a flip which will make a rollercoaster feel shy the real truth is that modi is desperate he doesnt even mind dancing with the devil this sardar patel event is evidence of that he will need nimble fingers to handle the rss but he knows the rsss compulsions even the rss knows it will have to somehow control modi but that again is for later both the rss and modi are playing games right now both just want to grab power after that they can both revert to what they really areminority bashers this article has been reproduced with permission from prashant pandey first

sabha member of the samajwadi party has dared imagine this alternative universe not just that yadav has asserted that the steel frame of india as the ias has been described should withdraw from uttar pradesh we will manage with our state service officers he says yadavs remark comes from the thick of battle with the samajwadi party ranged against durga shakti nagpal a yearold ias officer who took on the sandmining mafia and found herself transferred but its tempting to take the remark seriously the bureaucracy in uttar pradesh faces much political pressure perhaps more than in any other state a unicefplanning commission study in  found that between  and  nearly half the districtlevel officials in uttar pradesh were transferred within a year the study which looked at  poor districts in seven states including jharkhand madhya pradesh and bihar found that uttar pradeshs poorest people faced a vacuum one of every four districtlevel positions lay vacant transferor tabadlatales are legion upright officers are known to live out of suitcases often facing near permanent separation from their spouses many choose stability and adapt bureaucrats whisper of a hafta system a reference to both politically motivated transfers and the preferred weekly schedule for collecting bribes the political class has subjugated the ias this is because politicians need civil servants to make money they pick and choose the weakest and uttar pradesh has the worst politicians in india says tsr subramanian former union cabinet secretary also a former chief secretary of the state tired of its notoriety for underdevelopment poverty and a wellfed political patronage system in  the state ias association attempted a contentious cleanup that eventually proved disastrous they voted to identify the three most corrupt bureaucrats among themselves offering the administration details of their crimes over time two including akhand pratap singh became chief secretaries the third died several former state or cadre officers including siddhartha behura neera yadav and bs lalli face serious charges in the durga shakti case ias officers have decided to rally behind the young officer they say she is being victimised for doing an honest job the samajwadi party has retorted by filing a list of allegations against her almost immediately after she was suspended until the charges are disposed of her career will be in limbo says a sen­ior ias officer its as if different groups have their own stakes and are exploiting her case for their own benefit dr rajshekhar vundru an ias officer of the haryana cadre says young sdms are generally not handed such tough action they are never suspended suspensions are a new trend in up since the last  years he says her suspension is unwarranted the ias is bound by rules and procedures that need to be followed in line with constitutional principles uttar pradesh has another weakness albeit one thats commonly encountered in many states caste and political patronage move hand in hand there was a time when officers from outside the state were preferred as chief minister charan singh insisted on having two madrasis and two punjabis to manage a severe drought says jagdish khattar a former bureaucrat who was then serving in the state he says the state has gone from bad to worse political interference is always there but nothing  in up today where everything happens along caste lines while the media is rallying around nagpal the ruling samajwadi party sees it as an opportunity to show off its secular credentials its another matter that the district magistrates report supports nagpal and rebuts claims of possible threats to peace at the site of the mosque whose wall napal got demolished and the illegal mining spots peace prevails ias officers are meanwhile trying to assert themselves they are seeking a change of rules with fixed tenures for particular positings with minimum and maximum time prescriptions many seek changes in service rules to allow transparency by the rule book in several states officers cannot be moved at whim however it does not work in practice even so the ias association of bihar wants more safeguards for allindia service officers it has demanded revocation of nagpals suspension if there is a substantive mistake an inquiry is only to be expected but suspension is too severe especially for a young officer says manoj kumar srivastava a chiefsecretary rank officer from bihar there are few studies of the ias and almost none on their conflicts with politicians one by harvard  school professor lakshmi iyer found in  that bureaucrats are significantly  per cent likelier to be transferred when a new chief minister comes in such transfers are passed off as routine when in fact they are intended to put favourites in key positions or put known dissidents out of action similarly former civil servant nc saxena noted in a  paper that the poor shape of indias bureaucracy is linked to the countrys indifferent progress on millennium development goals theres growing belief that the politician is working handinglove with the bureaucrat the politician is not trusted at allthat is why there is outrage in durga shaktis case he says poverty rates declined  per cent less in districts which had a  per cent higher probability of politically induced transfers the harvard  school study found thats also why the ias ranks are resistingthe samajwadi partys argument that durgas is a routine administrative transfer vundru says the ias is still indias steel frame he too was once transferred five times in a short span for taking on the mining mafia in haryanas mewat region however i knew id be able to work in peace elsewhere there was no browbeating by politicians what we dont  in this nagpal case is that the matter has not come to a rest even after the transfer he says suspensions of ias officers are not rare in uttar pradesh regardless of regime says parthasarathy sen sharma a up cadre official who joined the ias in  whats different this time is that the case has caught the public imagination i hope durga shakti is given a fair trial and reinstated soon he says the sp and yadav may well imagine a state without the ias but as subramanian points out the services allindia nature has a logic its also about national integration but then things are always a little different in uttar pradesh now akhilesh has suspended husband of durga shakti nagpal mr abhishek another ias officer who is dm of the mathura that happens when power gors into hands of parivari politicians charges are anhisehk ney izzat nahin ki ji the durga shakti nagpal episode has been blown out of proportion to exhibit the innocence of the bureaucrats visavis their political masters the question is is the bureaucracy not taking advantage of this media outrage to assert itself and pinpoint its integrity though the real power is weilded by them moreover this media trial of the peoples representatives and the valorization of the civil servants may lead to a situation of meritocracy where the less priviliged and the depressed classes of the society may not raise their voices against the oligarchy of the bureaucrats as the voice of the political leaders is bitterly silenced by this overreaction of the bourgeois middle class dr nilanshu kumar agarwal a aawas vikas colony indira nagar rae bareli up pin cadrebased party  communists would be happier without ias as one would recall when jyoti basu was the chief minister he had expressed views to do without ias who were less likely to be pressurized there was a time when almost everyone of them wanted deputation outside the state but the corrupt ones in the ias are assets for political use akhand pratap singh may not be alone or confined in up alone two chief secretaries of a newly created state in  were nect deep in corruption one had fled away with a crore of rupees from a corporation he was heading as cmd years later he returned and went over to the newly created state he rose to be its cs the other too was equally gifted in corruption but retired as cs during the feelgood days one ias was acused of leaking sensitive information to women spying for an enemyy country he was to be suspended but his fatherinlaw was a minister he threw his wealth and rescued the nice boy for his straying into bad places for privacy with those moles nothing happened to the pampered boy though he deserved to be prosecuted for sedition the worst bureaucracy in the  which india has has more than politcicians to fight it also has to make itself serve the people rather than act as rulers in punjab where i live ias officers think no end of themselves looking for freebies  free lunches at restaurants and givernment  for their wives all going around with their red beacons that it is hard to say who is worse the politician or the bureacuract the credibility of bureaucrats will be restrored when they are seen to serve the people not themselves d bonita i hit  on your post but why ias is needed at all in states why not each state find their senior officers i think its an out of box question ramgopal yadavs thinking need merit assesment over to you since you edify better in this spoof from jug suraiya robert vadra has some good advice for akhilesh yadav on how to keep the civil servants in check i am writing this to express my sympathy for the plight you are facing thanks to your servant problem it is really a shame and a scandal whats happening in this country where increasingly our servants have absolutely no respect for their masters and go about behaving as though they are a law unto themselves take this durga of yours it is disgraceful the way she has poked her nose into things that should be of no concern to her  this sand mafia  so people are taking sand so what let them take it is it her fathers sand that she should object to people taking it who made the sand god made the sand and is god making a fuss about people taking his sand no god is not making a fuss so who is this durga to make such a hungama about it does she think shes superior to god read more here senior officers secretary level ias officer should protect their colleagues when they are being handed punishments if chief secretary had will he would not have signed instead they sideline with rulers to protect their posts and to get plum posts ias association never speaks for their junior officers if chief sec refuses the order from cm atleast these sort of things will reduce instead of protecting them senior ias officers are screwing their year books one swallow a summer does not make the ias mafia are closing ranks only because one of their ilk is at the politicians receiving end let us see them standing up to political pressure in other more important matters affecting the common man so whats new indira gandhi wanted a committed judiciary the samajwadi party and every other party wants a committed bureaucracy it would be better if these central cadre officers instead of opting for a state cadre at the time of joining opt for a party affiliation then everyone would know to whom they are committed and there would be no confusion the feudal mindset of akilesh mulayam and their ilk was evidenced through the formers having chargesheeted durga without even hearing her defence even before sonia could skyjack the issue for political gains the skeleton of vadara had started tottering in congress cupboard the steely resolve of a few ias officers  durga khemka who dared to take the bulls by horns deserves emulation by the rest of the peers some  sahayam umashankar and idhaya chandran to quote a few names of honest ias officers from south made history for many to follow them outlook

the new rs  notes mar    ist corruption howthisworks indian police service police police reforms supreme court by shiningpath by siddharth chatterjee and shining path the countrys image has been battered by screaming news headlines of human rights abuses tragic episodes of rapes spiralling crime rates and endemic violence close on the heels of the delhi gang rape episode the case of a young woman in punjab who was recently beaten up by policemen for trying to lodge a case of sexual harassment caused outrage once again in many parts of the country distrust of the police is so high that people either prefer to live with crimeharassment or enter the perceived safety of parallel protection rackets the police system being often described as inept malevolent and a political tool is this criticism justified in our view the litany of problems that beset the police force can be categorised thus archaic laws the institution is governed in accordance with the laws framed in  with few if any subsequent modifications suboptimal staffing compounded by poor selection training processes this also includes inability of members to remain in step with technology politicisation corruption and criminalisation of lawenforcement services lack of internal checks and balances substandard investigative capabilities and infrastructure which taint the subsequent steps of any criminal case when moving through indias criminal justice system ie prosecution and judgement complete absence of sensitization to womens rights childrens rights and above all human rights a crisis in leadership and command punjab police officials caught on camera beating a woman has raised questions about pending police reforms pti it needs to be emphasised that the duties of the police as prescribed in section  of the indian police act  have become totally outdated much water has flown down the ganges since then notes the malimath committee report before it goes on to highlight how newer dimensions that have been added to the nature of crime compel the police departments to divert a large chunk of their resources to these areas leaving much less for the routine crime work exacerbating matters is the woefully inadequate manpower strength a detailed report titled data on police organisations in india by the bureau of police research development contains damning statistics as of  january  there were  police personnel for every  citizens in states  uttar pradesh and bihar which have traditionally had greater law and order issues the ratio dips to about  police personnel per  citizens compare this with global norms  as laid down by the united nations  as followed by sweden norway canada australia and usa ironically while the average indian reels under the impact of such an abysmal police personnel to population ratio a clutch of about  vvips are protected by over  police personnel many of whom are better trained than the average policemen the police selection procedures and training on basic responsibilities laws and investigative processes are poorly designed and unprofessionally implemented what one is left with is a structure that is not aligned with the responsibilities it has to shoulder above all morale is low due to overextended work hours very poor remuneration and poor living standards the overall functioning of lowerlevel officers can be boosted by better training better pay and allowances and by creating a system that rewards initiative and positive action instead of negative behaviour there is not only a need to bolster lawenforcement agencies in order to increase the policetocitizen ratio but to also do it in a strategic manner it is imperative that many more female police officers be recruited to fill the rank and file as well as occupy leadership positions at present government rules require only  of police personnel to be women several states report ratios that are well below even the prescribed norm senior female officers are rare causing a significant gender imbalance in key leadership positions this must be remedied immediately corruption amongst police ranks is the stuff of legend according to a report the police in delhi are the most corrupt stories abound about bribery prefirfirst information report doctoring of facts and extortion by the police to file a report between  and  complaints against state police officers in the country rose by  from  to  whats more in  only  of the  complaints ended in conviction how about transgressions and police excesses and the mechanisms to address those an investigative team that has been specifically designed to look into crimes by police officers and one that is modelled after the internal affairs divisions of police forces in other countries could be an effective remedial measure officers in these units cannot be subject to the authority of the state ministers or the very police officers they are investigating thereby removing conflict of interest and allowing them to function without fear of retaliation india is the target of an evergrowing list of terrorist groups insurgent forces and criminal networks even petty criminals are now in possession of hitech gadgets that allow them better access and reduce their chances of being caught in such an environment the need for skill and competency upgradation of the police force is a sine qua non police reforms have been held up with states refusing to comply reuters over the past four decades there have been a multitude of committees panel reports and recommendations with clearly laid out roadmaps and supported by detailed descriptions on the kind of design and overhaul that is needed unfortunately most of these reports end up in a black hole or gather dust in a filing cabinet in fact the chief justice of india remarked in july  not a single state government is willing to cooperate what can we do various state governments presently stand in contempt of court with respect to the seven binding directions that the supreme court of india spelled out in  these directives address core issues  transfers tenure separating the investigation and law order functions of the police unwarranted influence or pressure by the state governments on the police and mechanisms to deal with complaints against the police these directives if implemented could go a long way in improving the performance of one of the most vital institutions of the country there is a strong case for the police to be given more independence from the states political machinery the indian supreme court is on record saying that many of the deficiencies in the functioning of police had arisen largely due to an overdose of unhealthy and petty political interference before concluding that it was important and in interest of the nation to insulate the police from political interference finally it is imperative to create a cradle of leadership for the police force of india  the national defence academy in india or west point in the us where promising officers from the armed forces are handpicked for their leadership potential and then trained india needs to create a similar institution that can focus on leadership building within the police force napoleons credo there are no bad soldiers only bad officers holds true in india promising individuals in the police must be nurtured and cultivated in an attempt to better the institution overall a good starting point would therefore be to push for compliance by the states on the apex courts  directives something that has been pointed out by dr kiran bedi and others the indian police can be redeemed by a mix of radical reforms and affirmative action the preservation of human rights and dignity should be the very corner stone for a robust police organization in addressing these problems india will restore the police to its original purpose to not only uphold the rule of law but to also serve a society where everyone feels safe and protected siddharth

metropolitan transport corporation bmtc we are trying to operate as many as buses as possible on all important routes in and around the city the bmtc introduced  buses as part of its big trunk service recently what has been the response from the commuters there is a good response from commuters to the big trunk service that was introduced on hosur road recently we want to introduce such services on other important routes too we have already identified  corridors for the introduction of big trunk bus service for the benefit of commuters you are the incharge minister for bangalore are you happy with the potholeridden roads in the city i am not happy with the infrastructure facility in the city many roads are full of potholes thus making commuting difficult for motorists in the city most of the main roads were not asphalted for many years the bbmp asphalted only crossroads and neglected the main ones do you agree that potholes have become bottlenecks for the smooth movement of bmtc buses yes the movement of bmtc buses has affected to some extent due to potholes on the roads major roads in the city are choked with traffic jams there is a need to widen and strengthen the city roads the bbmp is geared up to take up pothole filling on a war footing the bmtc was known for making profits now it is in the red how do you propose to make the bmtc profitable again the bmtc incurred losses last year i got this portfolio around four months ago i am confident of making the bmtc profitable by the end of current fiscal it is alleged that bmtc bus conductors indulge in corrupt practices by issuing fake tickets how do you propose to control this the bmtc authorities are taking a number of measures to identify and punish bus conductors who indulge in corrupt practices the checking squad has intensified its operations to control ticketless traveling in the bmtc buses there are complaints against bmtc staff over their rude behaviour too the bmtc staff are expected to treat commuters

bhushan pulls no punches and offers an explanation to uttam sengupta excerpts you and the attorneygeneral to put it mildly have no love lost between you what provokes such antagonism a dishonest government needs a dishonest law officer to legitimise their corrupt decisions and the present ag unfortunately has been shielding the governments questionable decisions you even called him a liar in court was that just courtroom bluster when he denied in court having seen the cbis status report on the coalgate scam i did say he was lying by that time the letter addressed to him by the additional solicitorgeneral harin raval was in the public domain raval had quit and had stated that the ag had misled the court but why didnt the court pull him up then why was it so indulgent i can only speculate the bench is possibly hesitant about taking action against the highest law officer of the government who is appearing before them every day perhaps they are meeting him socially and you do tend to be a little diffident in cases involving such people you say the ag is giving dishonest advice to the government shielding the corrupt and misleading the court and yet the supreme court of india does not take any action his role in shielding anil ambaniwho he calls a friend in the g scam and reliance power caseand the ruias are there for everyone to see his advice in the disproportionate assets cases against mulayam singh yadav and mayawati are also questionable and yes the supreme court has been soft on the ag could the ag have done things differently he could have recused himself from cases involving his friends but he never did that why do you think he gets away if his conduct is so questionable the attorneygeneral is of course very smart all people  that are he is also socially active and is smooth he is very deferential to the court very polite the day i called him a liar in court he came up to me and said prashant you must believe me i really did not see the report when you are so brazen you can get away with anything had his personality been different had he been arrogant and aloof the courts attitude would have been different perhaps there are people in the bar however who are sympathetic to him former attorneygeneral soli sorabjee for example mr sorabjee will be sympathetic towards all dishonest lawyers when he was the attorneygeneral he had attended a meeting in london with the hindujas and their lawyers from the law firm of clifford chance and the minutes of the meeting quoted him advising that the hindujas should get the ministries to seek an opinion from him and then he would give an opinion that would suit them i had then written in frontline criticising mr sorabjee what was the then ags reaction the same as mr vahanvatis he came up to me and said prashant i wish you had checked with me before writing the article i would have set the record straight it is a sign of the times if tomorrow a video footage shows the ag accepting money i dont think either he or the government would be perturbed they would laconically say that the footage should be sent for forensic examination and that it was mischievous and mala fide nobody blinks an eyelid has there been a precedent to vahanvatis conduct the only comparable name that comes to mind is g ramaswamy who was the attorneygeneral in  but his tenure was short dear prashant if what you said above is correct then the bench at sc is also shying from its constitutional and mandatory duties to put it simply its still an era of face law prevailing over case laws lets pray that atlest sc judges get embolden you have done your job people  you are real lokpals wow what a big mouth it seems mr prashant bhusan believe only honest person on planet earth is prshant

guidelines to restrain political parties from promising freebies to voters in their election manifestos file photo although the law is obvious that promises made in an election manifesto cannot be construed as a corrupt practice under section  of the representation of the people act the reality is that distribution of freebies of any kind undoubtedly influences all people and it affects the levelplaying field the supreme court said on friday a bench of justices p sathasivam and ranjan gogoi said freebies shake the root of free and fair elections to a large degree considering that there is no enactment that directly governs the contents of the manifesto the bench directed the election commission to frame guidelines for the same in consultation with all recognised parties a separate head for manifesto guidelines could be included in the model code of conduct for the guidance of political parties and candidates the judges said we are mindful of the fact that generally parties release their manifesto before the announcement of the election date in that scenario strictly speaking the election commission will not have the authority to regulate any act which is done before the announcement of the date nevertheless an exception can be made in this regard as the purpose of the manifesto is directly associated with the election process the bench directed the commission to take up this task as early as possible considering its importance it recorded the need for a separate law to be passed by the legislature in this regard for governing the political parties referring to the offer of tv sets the court said it is not in dispute that television is a widely used telecommunication medium for receiving moving images today television has a lot of positive effects and influences on our society and culture television gives helpful information and it is not an equipment aimed for entertainment alone the state tamil nadu government has also asserted that the purpose of distributing colour television sets is not restricted to providing recreation but extends to provide general knowledge to the people more particularly to the household women hence we are not inclined to agree with the argument of the appellant that giving of colour tvs laptops mixergrinders etc by the government after adhering to due process is not an expense for public purpose judicial interference is permissible when the action of the government is unconstitutional and not when such action is not wise or that the extent of expenditure is not for the good of the state all such

the finance ministers justification of the totally indefensible hike in indias wellhead price for dry natural gas the absence of any evidencebased research backing key economic decisions is the true economic reality of india which is today the only country in the  that sees no difference between the wellhead price of natural gas and the price of liquefied natural gas lng the core argument being presented is that the higher price will yield higher upstream investment in untapped hydrocarbon frontiers resulting in higher output of domestic natural gas and the reduction or even elimination of indias import dependence on even costlier lng thereby improving the countrys fiscal stability and energy security unfortunately this argument is fallacious on several counts decline in output first the government itself admits that despite raising the domestic wellhead price of natural gas by almost  per cent from as low as mmbtu to as high as mmbtu investments in the sector and the countrys gas output have actually dropped the bulk of this drop is because of reliance industries ltd ril the company whose demands triggered the recent price increase the comptroller and auditor general report explicitly outlines how ril reneged on its production commitments while goldplating its investments can the government guarantee that a price of mmbtu will raise gas availability what if history repeats itself and it does not will the government then find more ways to raise prices even further how long will the government wait to do so does it have a longterm vision based on geopolitical developments in the energy sector especially gas where canada and the us are poised to become major lng exporters significantly the single largest instance of foreign direct investment that the above cited  per cent price increase attracted was bps acquisition of a  per cent stake in rils declining kg basin play and not in any new greenfield frontier bp is not known to invest  billionplus for improving a countrys fiscal or energy balance the company must have seen returns from a known discovery even at the then approved price of mmbtu second the import parity price for a globally traded commodity such as crude oil unlike natural gas that has justifiably been in place since the s has not succeeded in raising domestic crude production significantly or attracted significant fdi in the indian sedimentary basin here too the single largest investment was the purchase of a foreign companys stake in an existing onshore field in rajasthan finally and most importantly even if the government is right what is the justification for raising the price of gas from existing fields we can always pay a higher price for more difficult horizons provided the duly approved and audited costs of exploration and production warrant that the current production was realised with no prospect of getting mmbtu will the government spell out its plan for this windfall profit it is bequeathing to current producers at the cost of the common man and honest taxpayers it has been argued that the bulk of the benefits from the price hike will go to the public sector however we all know that the upstream public sector companies are milked by the government through ad hoc burdens such as funding underrecoveries hence the real beneficiaries will be private gas producers unless the government also announces policies that place the same burdens on upstream private and public sector companies but that would defeat the real purpose of the price increase wouldnt it a bogey used to milk the upstream public sector is the absence of profitsharing in the nomination blocks that they received in the prenelp era it would be educational for me and others if the government would make public the exact amount of profit gas and profit oil that it has received from private producers since the new exploration licensing policy was instituted in any event the entire fairy tale of fiscal stability has now been undermined by none other than the finance minister himself in his press briefing on friday he opened the door for subsidising the purchase of gas for the power and fertilizer sectors that together use over  per cent of the available gas in india cheating doublecheating  the mmbtu price the last time i am intrigued by the choice of the number mmbtu this time around in everyday language these numbers are used to signify cheating and doublecheating the price of  was derived based on a ril formula that had never been used and is still not used anywhere in the  to price natural gas at the wellhead or any other form of gas anywhere the  number reportedly flows from the rangarajan formula which again is not used anywhere else in the  to establish the wellhead price of natural gas or any other form of gas anywhere can the government identify even a single gas field in the  that gets a well head price of mmbtu for conventional dry natural gas how come investments keep taking place elsewhere without resorting to such dubious pricing formulae can dr rangarajan identify which element in his formula represents the wellhead price for dry natural gas actually received by conventional natural gas producers around the  the truth is that none of the elements in the rangarajan formula represents the wellhead price it sets out to establish and yet it magically delivers a price at exactly twice the  level the henry hub spot price currently at mmbtu which is the only relevant element in the rangarajan formula is also greater than the wellhead price received by producers of conventional dry natural gas in the us gigantic scam strong words are typically not in my vocabulary so let me simply say that i agree with gurudas dasgupta mp that a gigantic scam is being perpetrated on the impoverished people of our country i also agree with former union revenue secretary eas sarmas assertion that the gas price hike is a policy initiative that socialises costs and privatises profits let us not forget that the same kg basin gas that was once offered to ntpc at mmbtu for  years and which is documented to cost under a dollar per mmbtu to produce received mmbtu in the first five years and is now guaranteed to receive twice that or more in the next five years this is the road to wealth in a country wherein some  per cent of the people live below the day purchasing power parity threshold i urge the noncongress leaders to join hands with mr dasgupta in stopping this loot perhaps the supreme court that placed very clear responsibilities on the government while pronouncing its judgment on the gas dispute between the then warring ambani brothers will take note of what is going on especially in light of the cags findings on the kg basin let me add that if indeed india is floating on natural gas raising the wellhead price of dry natural gas to levels unheard of anywhere else in the  is the worst policy option to release this national wealth such an option works best when reserves are limited and producers gold plate their investment to extract the much needed energy at higher and higher prices to achieve the investment multiples that current policies guarantee just as the cag discovered in the case of kg basin in closing let me inform the honourable petroleum minster that everyone related to the hydrocarbon field in india knows that i do not represent any lobby not even the oil and gas import lobby that our petroleum minister seems to have inside information on my old and new clothes do not come from any vested interest

syed ali shah geelani from the jamaat e islami a group founded in undivided india by the great intellectual from maharashtra abul ala maududi maududi opposed partition saying that muslims could not be defined through territorial nationalism but only through faith he also opposed the first raid into kashmir launched under governor general jinnah arguing that jihad could only be declared officially by the state using its army not through freelancers he was born in aurangabad but moved to lahore in  remaining there and setting up the jamaat which is today more powerful and larger in pakistan than in india maududi reconciled with the idea of pakistan and was on the side of president zia ul haq when he moved the laws that islamised certain punishments in the pakistan penal code archive image of indian policemen standing guard along an empty  arcade reuters geelani is associated with the jamaat only in kashmir the indian side of the body has declared itself apolitical does not contest elections and has only a loose affiliation with geelanis unit friendly relations as they told me some years ago what geelani wants is clear and uncomplicated he wants kashmir to merge with pakistan and he wants this because it is a muslim state and therefore should be governed under sharia he does not compromise on this demand and because of this perceived lack of flexibility he had to be removed from the hurriyat conference that group of kashmiri separatists is more flexible and willing to negotiate with the indian state geelani on the other hand is so uncompromising that even pakistans conduct does not meet with his approval he declined to visit pakistan a couple of months ago upset by its normalisation move with india he dismisses the idea that trade over the line of control is important kashmir is not an economic issue or an issue of trade ties but an issue linked to the death and survival of a nation he said trade ties cannot change the ground reality which is that this bloody line has consumed thousands of lives geelani remains along with mirwaiz omar farooq kashmirs most popular leader however farooq does not or perhaps cannot offer to his constituents what geelani does a fullthroated denounciation of indias secular constitution this has left the field to geelani who best represents the anger and resentment that kashmirispeaking muslims feel towards india other leaders of the hurriyat have all softened abdul gani lone did it first and died for it the otherwise propakistan abdul gani bhat he told me in  that pakistans economy was superior to indias said last year that the united nations resolutions in kashmir were no longer enforceable for saying this he was suspended from the hurriyat conference officially the groups position remains that the resolutions be implemented with some saying that the plebiscite vote should include an independence option the mirwaiz says he accepts india is secular and democratic but even so kashmiris should be allowed to determine whether they want any part of it unofficially the hurriyat leaders want to engage india and take a  of power they cannot do so for fear of geelani geelani is unafraid of saying things that would hurt people fifteen or so years ago i interviewed him from hyderabad when india and pakistan were shelling each other just as kargil had begun he told me of his beliefs about the bravery of the mujahideen and the cowardice of the indian army i took it down as a reporter should and the editor chose not to carry the piece saying it was too acidic for the readers geelani did not fully apreciate the indian or perhaps subcontinental ability to absorb great pain in the cause of its territory the deadlock in kashmir awaits an event the exit of syed ali shah geelani who is

pulling each other down if they think they can win hearts of the people by using flowery language they are mistaken india is not just any other country the congress chief said during an election rally

understood it nor will they ever understand they turn a brother against a brother for their selfish ends there is a need to be cautious about them she said gandhis frontal attack on modi came a day

the centre send this money so that it enters the lockers of corrupt system or was this money sent from the centre so the common people of madhya pradesh get facilities she said gandhi alleged that bjp

the gujarat cm is a highly divisive political figure and his pm candidature can hurt the bjps fortunes in states  rajasthan and madhya pradesh mp cm shivraj chouhan had allegedly appealed to the bjps parliamentary body that modis pm candidate announcement be put on hold till the polls one can safely say that advanis issues with modi or at least the way the senior leader portrays it stems from the fact that the gujarat cm is not considered to be an inclusive or secular politician however in his book advani had gone all out to debunk the same theory he is now fixated with in it he says modis reelection has highlighted several lessons which are relevant not only for gujarat but for the whole country he has disproved the conventional wisdom that focus on good governance does not make good politics he has dispelled the notion that elections cannot be won on a development plank compare this unabashed praise with the only endorsement modi has got from advani in the recent days in a rally

attempt to make sure he doesnt stick out as a sore thumb in the bjp in  advani was the defacto pm candidate of the bjp the party fared miserably putting advanis pm ambitions on a backburner yet again

minister narendra modi will  the stage in ahmedabad later in the day at a function to commemorate india`s iron man calling modi a pretender information and broadcasting minister manish tewari slammed the bharatiya janata partys prime ministerial candidate for trying to take over sardar patel`s legacy sardar patel blamed bjp`s mentor rashtriya swayamsevak sanghs communal poison for the sacrifice of mahatma gandhi modi must explain if he agrees with patel`s views said tewari for last few months bjp is trying to usurp the legacy of sardar patel history is witness to the fact that those who do not have any history of legacy try to appropriate the same of others my advice to the gujarat chief minister who is the prime ministerial candidate of the bjp and a rss swayamsevak is that he should study what the legacy actually is that he is trying to appropriate tewari told reporters on september   patel the then home minister of the country had written to rss founder ms golwalkar in which the former had said that as a final result of communal poison the country had to suffer the sacrifice of life by mahatma gandhi patel referred to communal poison spread by rss that golwalkar headed does swayamsevak modi agree with patel or endorses his views rss whose legacy they crave he said as a student of history it has always intrigued me that rss and bjp have been making attempts unsuccessfully to appropriate the legacy of patel i want to ask bjp and their newlyanointed pretender do they endorse these views of patel about rss which is the mother of bjp tewari said hailing the indian national congress tewari said the indian freedom struggle was conceived conceptualised and led by his party tewari said there is no dispute over patel`s legacy and it is settled patel being a congress leader before talking to reporters tewari had tweeted  patel to golwalkar as a final result of communal poison country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of gandhiji patel refers to communal poison spread by rss that golwalkar headed does syamsevak modi agree with patel on rss whose legacy they crave earlier this morning modi in his tweet `thanked` a newspaper for issuing clarification about a statement regarding sardar patel`s funeral that he said was wrongly attributed to him to a question about modi saying he was misquoted about nehru not attending the funeral of sardar patel tewari said when you don`t read or write you make such bloomers and when you make the bloomer the media always becomes the whipping boy i do not know why the media is so kind to him modi`s remark about nehru had led to a huge controversy with digvijay singh hitting back at the gujarat chief minister calling him a megalomaniac psychopath liar alleging that communal polarisation in the country happened due to the character conduct and functioning of the bjp tewari accused the bjp of doublespeak on the issue of terrorism reminding the opposition party of the release of terrorists during the kandhar plane hijack history shows that whenever terrorism raised its head they did not have the competence to deal with it he said claiming that on the other hand the congressled upa has shown zero tolerance as far the question of terror is concerned the upa government has always maintained zero tolerance policy whenever any terrorist activity took place anywhere those who were responsible for such incidents should be tracked down to the last corner of the  let there be absolutely no confusion on the question of terror in the last ten years the upa has strengthened the country`s capability to fight terror tewari said he also said that while the upa has been restrained and temperate in political discourse the bjp has shown complete hysteria and intemperance congress leaders had hit out at modi citing his quote in the newspaper that india`s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru never attended the funeral of sardar patel in  bjp has often accused congress of ignoring patel`s legacy and promoting nehrugandhi dynasty modi who has often criticised upa of weak response on terrorism and handling pakistan had also been making a big issue of his proposed plan to construct the longest

arun jaitley today said the government will not go soft on bringing unaccounted wealth back into the formal system this black money is not an issue which we are going to go soft on because ultimately the target of any economy as it grows is to bring more and more resources into the system he said at the india summit  organised by the economist magazine the black money problem jaitley said is a problem confined to few individuals we were reasonable enough to put people on notice and gave them a fair opportunity to bring them in i can only tell that those who disagree on black money issue well we will agree to differ he said jaitley said he had representations from people requesting him to go easy on domestic black money i must tell you with great sense of discomfort that i have delegations coming to me saying even on domestic black money please go easy because this is at least adding to economic activity now no economy can indefinitely sustain an argument of this kind he said the government has from july   enacted the black money undisclosed foreign income and assets and imposition of tax act to deal with foreign black money the act provides for tax and penalty of  per cent and jail term of up to  years for holding undisclosed foreign assets it also provided a day compliance window to escape the harsh punishment by declaring the assets and paying  per cent tax and penalty as far as dealing with domestic black money is concerned the government has already introduced the benami transactions prohibition amendment bill  in the lok sabha and it is currently being scrutinised by the standing committee it provides for attachment and confiscation of benami properties and also fine with imprisonment jaitley said india needs all its resources to come within the system ultimately the expansion of our banking system the payments banks other scheme which we are still considering the pipeline will try and bring all these resources into the banking system the

anita kapur chairperson of the central board of direct taxes cbdt tells ht that implementation of goods and services tax gst will help control black money troubles and talks about other challenges edited excerpts how can taxes be reduced in india in years to come tax rates and liability will be reduced if everyone pays taxes honestly the challenge in india is that we have a large number of nonfilers plus a huge number of filers who understate income the cbdt is trying to curb these two segments for good revenue we are working to solve this by reaching out to people in a nonintrusive manner what can be an effective policy initiative to curb black money implementation of gst can help in curbing domestic black money though it is a reform for indirect taxes there are filers who understate incomes by not reporting each and every transaction by doing this they not only save on the excise vat octroi etc but also under report incomes such practices lead to generation of black money in the system once gst is in place we will also have the correct and exact data of transactions and then the tax department can counter check the gst returns filed by these people against their declared incomes so it will be an enabler for direct taxes too what is the status on mandatory quoting of pan for large transactions as of now there is no rethinking making pan mandatory in terms of the finance ministers budget speech requires an amendment in the incometax rule b we will be putting it up for the finance ministers consideration for approval of the changes once it is done we will notify it for the implementation how successful have the initiatives for easing tax filing been at present over  of people file returns after office hours earlier when tax returns were filed manually one had to take a day off from work similarly over  of the taxes are paid through net banking and atms thus linking net banking to paying returns is also yielding benefits more such efforts will be taken soon to further ease processes for the taxpayers how many people are linking aadhar numbers with their tax filing to cut down verification till now over  million returns have been verified electronically through onetime password otp over  million have linked their aadhar numbers though not all have filed returns yet people are choosing to cut out the cumbersome process of printing forms and sending them to bengaluru we would encourage people to use the otp facility and file correct details to help the department process returns and issue refunds in a seamless manner we have till now received  million efiled returns and the efiling period has still not ended we expect the numbers to increase"},{"Date":"27 Jul

need to know about the new rs  notes jul    ist arun jaitley black money credit card debit card fatca inmyopinion narendra modi  bank by vivek kaul in the ten years that i have lived in mumbai i have managed to go to goa regularly especially during the rains when i find the state to be very beautiful the roads in the state are fantastic and it is a pleasure being driven around the seafood is fresh the hotels are clean and the booze is cheap though i dont consume alcohol on most days also during the rains there are fewer tourists going around hence there is some peace and quiet representational image afp the trouble is that almost everyone in goa other than the five star hotels wants to be paid in cash be it hotels shacks taxi services restaurants and so on also many of the merchants mentioned above do not  the idea of issuing a proper bill many bills are handwritten on plane pieces of paper with no way of figuring out later where the money was actually spent further there seems to be concerted effort not to accept creditdebit cards this in an era where even most kiranawallahs in metropolitan india accept cards why is that the case the only possible explanation is that people dont want to pay the right amount of tax on the money they are making through tourism and the moment they start accepting creditdebit cards there will be some record of money spent by tourists at their establishment this will lead to a situation where underdeclaring income will become more difficult and tax will have to be paid accepting only cash for payment rules out this possibility totally data from the goa tourism department shows that a total of  million tourists visited goa in  the number has jumped more than  times from the  lakh tourists who visited the state in  the number of foreign tourists visiting the state in  stood at  lakh given the huge number of tourists visiting the state every year and the fact that most payments need to be made in cash the amount of black money being generated in goa must be huge black money is essentially money which has been earned but on which no tax has been paid the finance minister arun jaitley during the course of his budget speech in february  had remarked one way to curb the flow of black money is to discourage transactions in cash now that a majority of indians has or can have a rupay debit card i therefore propose to introduce soon several measures that will incentivize credit or debit card transactions and disincentivise cash transactions while this is a noble thought just encouraging people to use rupay debit cards is not enough i may want to spend money using a debit card but the merchant should also be ready to accept a payment through a card if that is not the case as it is in goa all the debit cards in the  wont make any difference what is the solution to this it should be made compulsory for merchant establishments of a certain size to accept creditdebit cards understandably this will not be easy to implement nevertheless a start has to be made at least those who want to pay by cards should have the option of doing so the narendra modi government since coming to power has talked a lot about getting back the black money that has left the shores of the country but there hasnt been much talk or action about domestic black money ultimately almost all black money is initially domestic given that it is generated within the country nevertheless there has been a strange fascination for getting back the black money that has left the shores of this country even though not much is likely to come from it even the  banks programme of chasing black money hasnt met with much success as dev kar chief economist global financial integrity wrote in a recent column in the indian express the  banks stolen asset recovery programme has since its inception in september  assisted in recovering only a minuscule portion of illicit assets stashed abroad this notwithstanding the full support of the banks nearuniversal membership of states and its own considerable human and financial resources in the fray the reason for this is that much of this money has been stashed away in tax havens and they are not going to give away the data any time soon as kar writes there has been scant progress against tax haven secrecy aided by little or no regulatory oversight tax havens have been absorbing illicit funds from poor developing countries for decades thirty days of demonetisation future reforms must take into account mans nature demonetisation the road from savings to debt goes via cashless credit demonetisation is metacorruption and jugaad getting the better of good intent even the american act known as fatca in short against black money is not expected to have much of an impact the foreign account tax compliance act fatca of the united states was passed in  as per the act every financial institution outside the united states needs to figure out whether it has american citizens as clients having done that it needs to report the information to the internal revenue service of the united states despite such provisions the act is expected to have a limited amount of success recovering black money jane g gravelle writing in a research paper titled tax havens international tax avoidance and evasion for the congressional research service estimates that fatca is expected to have a relatively small effect  billion over  years when compared with estimated costs of international evasion of around  billion a year so the united states expects to recover around  million from fatca every year though the black money being generated is close to  billion per year when the united states and the  bank have had limited success on trying to recover international black money it is safe to say that indias efforts on this front are not going to lead to much success given this it makes sense for the modi government to concentrate on domestic black money and make sure that tax compliance improves over the years they need to work towards ensuring that black money is not generated in the first place nevertheless as the old hindi saying goes ghar ki murgi daal barabar hence the focus on trying to recover black money that has already left the shores of the country is likely to continue vivek kaul is the author of the easy money trilogy he tweets kaulvivek first published

unaccounted funds to generate fictitious long term capital gain ltcg it further said such rampant manipulations call for concerted and coordinated action by the agencies concerned sebis proactive role in the above context is crucial it is surprising that the regulator needed to be goaded and pushed in this manner after all sebi should have been on top of this issue on its own my magazine has been openly writing about this blackkawhite scheme for years also sebi had grandly claimed in december  and again in april  that it has busted schemes that misuse the stockmarket platform for moneylaundering obviously what sebi claimed as a huge crackdown on those two occasions hardly scratched the surface indeed in his letter to the sebi chairman mr das writes the investigation directorates of ahmedabad and kolkata have already shared findings of their investigation in the bogus ltcg cases with sebi with a request to take further necessary action against the unscrupulous  brokersentities who have misused the stock market copies of letters dated    and  from ahmedabad investigation directorate and letter dated  from the kolkata investigation directorate note that the first letter was a year old mr das then informs the sebi chairman that central board of direct taxes is also in receipt of ad interim orders passed by sebi so far seven cases in connection with the bogus ltcg racket these orders were passed on to the relevant investigation directorates of itd for taking necessary action against the beneficiaries then comes the bombshell although couched in polite bureaucratese mr das writes investigations conducted by itd in the transactions of the aforesaid nature could not bear the desired fruits inter alia for the reasons that in most of such transactions the regulators concerned such as sebi did not record any adverse finding qua such transactions judicial authorities have held that unless the corporate veil is lifted onus on revenue is not discharged the action taken by sebi in such cases unravelling the facade is of critical importance in these cases for effective handling of menace of bogus ltcg we do not know why sebi did not record any adverse finding all we know is that in mid the earlier government with p chidambaram as the finance minister had granted draconian powers to sebi under which it can enter and search buildings places vessels vehicles and aircraft of defaulters its officers can break open the lock of any door box locker safe almirah etc to get information it can ask for information or records from any person banks authorities boards or corporation it has the powers of search and seizure attachment of properties and arrest and detention of defaulters as well as pass disgorgement directions finally the government has also allowed the market regulator to seek information from other regulators within india and abroad with retrospective effect going as far back as  and yet mr das had to remind u k sinha sebi chairman to tear down the corporate veil he also had to remind him to take necessary action in the  scrips identified by the kolkata investigation directorate while sebi has twice invested in highly sophisticated and expensive market surveillance software the finance ministry had to tell sebi to devise a mechanism to raise triggers on this kind of suspicious trading on real time basis so that preventive action could be taken before laundering takes place mr das ends his letter with a reminder that the incometax act  prescribes time limits within which assessments can be completed and tax demands can be raised therefore timely action from sebi in such cases would help in ensuring appropriate actions by the income tax authorities sebi may take note of violations of kyc norms by the stock brokers for further appropriate action tax experts tell me that black money generation will slowly die down if that money cant be laundered today the single most popular route of laundering is the stock market platform if mr modi really wants to crack down on black money he must take a close look at what sebi has been up to nobody is supervising the regulator at all

at rs  lakh or more purchase of any motor vehicle and payment of bills exceeding rs  in one go at hotels and restaurants among other things the government is looking at lowering thresholds for mandatory furnishing of pan card where they are too high and increasing the limits where they are too low besides it will add new items to the list of transactions where furnishing of pan is mandatory some irrelevant transactions will be removed from that list in the case of airs the government will likely expand the list of thirdparty sources for mandatory reporting seven sources at present and also revisit the thresholds we will revisit the thresholds by lowering them in the cases where they are too high and raise the limits in the cases where they are too low and lead to excessive information flow that we do not require for both pan card furnishing and air we will add more transactions and thirdparty sources to the list for air and delete those that have become irrelevant basically it will be rationalisation of incometax rules he added quoting pan is mandatory for cash deposits aggregating rs  or more at banks or life insurance premiums of more than rs  a year there are seven categories of transactions where thirdparties  banks mutual funds and insurance companies have to report transactions by individuals to the incometax department for instance if you deposit rs  lakh or more in a year the bank concerned will have to report it to the department the department will then use this information to see if the assessee concerned files accurate returns a company issuing credit cards where payment against bills exceeds rs  lakh in a year for a person also has to report this to the department similarly mutual funds collecting rs  lakh or more for sale of units by one person companies receiving rs  lakh or more against issue of shares bondsdebentures and registrarsubregistrars in respect of salepurchase of immovable  exceeding rs  lakh and the reserve bank of india for issue of bonds exceeding rs  lakh have to report the transactions to the department the move will definitely have some deterring impact on flow of domestic black money said rahul garg leader direct taxes pwc rakesh nangia managing partner nangia and co said tackling of black money was a serious challenge for the government it is a much bigger issue domestically the move on rationalisation of transactions and the limits will definitely address the issue to some extent he said recently the authorities took various measures to deter those involved in circulation of black money for instance targeting domestic flow and generation of black money in the mining sector cbdt instructed incometax officials to scrutinise production details and tax returns filed by the companies engaged in mining activities and to take appropriate action in case a discrepancy was found finance minister arun jaitley had pointed out in a  post last month that the bulk of black money was still within india there was a need to change the national attitude so that plastic currency became the norm and cash an exception the government is working with various authorities to incentivise this change he had said targeting the black money stashed abroad by indians the government had provided a threemonth compliance window that ended on september  during this period declarations worth rs

slidemargin  the government has however offered a onetime opportunity to individuals to declare their undisclosed foreign assets and incomes and avoid penal action all that they would be required to do is pay tax at the rate of  per cent along with a penalty of  per cent on the declared foreign income or assets declared while foreign assets have been divided into eight categories three methods have been provided for valuation of different assets for declaration purpose but a closer look into the procedure shows that getting a fair valuation is a tricky affair in case of certain assets and individuals need to know what process is to be adopted listed below is the process of valuation for various assets jewellery as per clause a of rule  the value of jewellery and precious stones shall be taken at cost or fair market value whichever higher for calculating the fairmarket value the assessee should obtain a report from a governmentrecognised valuer in the country where the assets are located however in case of gold and jewellery the assessee may end up paying less tax than on other foreign assets  bank deposits because the fairmarket value of gold is lower in several countries in comparison to india along with this there may also be substantial difference in the valuation of precious stones artifacts clause b of rule  provides the procedure for valuation of artifacts  archeological collections drawings paintings sculptures etc the valuation of such assets is subjective and may vary depending upon the valuer and the country the fairmarket value can be decided only on the basis of auction of the artifacts shares and securities the process of valuation of listed shares and securities is rather simple and the assessee has to disclose the value that is higher of the acquisition cost or market value at the time of declaration the process however is much cumbersome for an unlisted company if the assessee is holding shares of an unlisted company then he has to first get valuation report of all the assets of that firm from a governmentrecognised valuer and then disclose the value of his holding even if one is holding  per cent stake in the company he would be required to get the valuation of whole company done to arrive at the value of his holding immovable  clause d of rule  provides the procedure to get fairmarket value of immovable properties and the disclosure should be of the value that is higher of the acquisition cost or fairmarket value the fairmarket value assessment has to be done by a government recognised valuer in that country bank account clause e of rule  provides the procedure for valuation of an account with the bank in order arrive at the value of declaration in this case all credits to the account from the date of opening will have to be added and any withdrawals made and redeposit of withdrawal at a later date will have to be excluded also the amount on which taxes and penalties have already been recovered before the declaration has to be excluded the problem in this case is that it is tough to get details of all transactions in the account especially if the account is an old one so if one had opened the account  years ago he will have to provide the details for the entire period suppose an assessee withdrew  lakh from his overseas account in  to  a  that was later sold in  for  lakh and deposited the proceeds in the bank account the question arises is whether to pay tax on  lakh or  lakh it ideally has to be on surplus deposit of  lakh but in case the assessee does not have details of transactions and cant provide supporting documents of the  transaction he will be liable to pay tax on full amount of  lakh interest in partnership firm the clause f g of rule  provides the procedure for valuation of interest in partnership firm the valuation of  in a partnership firm has to be determined by dividing the net assets of the firm in the ratio as mentioned in the partnership deed that will become applicable at the time of dissolution the valuation process is similar to that of holding in unlisted companies as per the notification by ministry of finance the window for declaration is open for three months between july  to september   and both the valuation and declaration of undisclosed foreign assets has to be completed within this period while declarations once made cant be rectified wrong declaration will be treated as invalid also if there is any dispute relating to valuation no opportunity will be provided for rectification this may not be very easy as it would be difficult to complete the valuation process for assets  unquoted shares or  in partnership firm within the stipulated three months even in the case of bank account it may be difficult to comply within the deadline if an individual has a trading  abroad and all transactions are routed through his personal foreign bank account but no books of account has been maintained then in such case it will become difficult for the individual to provide details the transactions in his account in some countries  the uae there is no income tax and also no legal requirement to maintain books of accounts for tax purpose in such cases it will be difficult for individuals to get details of all transactions in the bank account the new act and rules are not applicable to nonresident and notordinary resident suppose an assessee has opened the bank account  years back and for the last five years he is an indian resident in such cases only assets that have been acquired from the income taxable in india will be liable to tax income earned outside india as a nonresident would not be subject to tax it is duty of assessee to explain the source of income and provide the evidence in support of source of income for the acquisition of foreign asset however if the assessee has no explanation of the source of income for acquisition of such assets then he will be liable to pay tax on fairmarket value of the asset in past whenever any amnesty scheme was announced by the government the declarations made were accepted as it is and individuals were not questioned even under foreign exchange remittance scheme of  declarations were accepted as it is this is an opportunity to come clean by declaring undisclosed foreign income and assets even though there may be problem in valuation of assets in few cases the

july the rules and frequently asked questions faqs clarifying the provisions have been issued by the central board of direct taxes a window of three months from july to september  has been provided to persons who have undisclosed foreign assets to declare such these by paying a tax of  and a penalty of  totalling  under this act thereafter any foreign assets found would attract a tax of  plus a penalty of  a total of  besides rigorous imprisonment for  years and a fine nondisclosure of a foreign asset in the return would invite a penalty of rs lakh plus rigorous imprisonment from six months to seven years and a fine given such harsh consequences the least that one would expect is that the law be crystal clear as to what disclosures are required and who is required to make such disclosures unfortunately there are various aspects of the law on which there is no clarity one would have expected that the faqs would clarify these issues but the faqs have not dealt with some of these issues and have added to the confusion in some unlike tax laws a taxpayer cannot purely rely upon legal advice in such situations as the consequences of an incorrect view is at best a long drawn prosecution proceeding and at worst rigorous imprisonment further such ambiguity provides tax officers a handle to harass taxpayers who may not be liable under the law but who would obviously not relish the prospect of facing prosecution it is amply clear from the law as well as the faqs that an undisclosed asset would be one acquired out of undisclosed income which was chargeable to tax in india a mere nondisclosure of such an asset in the foreign assets section of the income tax return would not make it an undisclosed asset it appears that the beneficiary of a discretionary foreign trust is not required to make any disclosure of the fact in the foreign assets section of his income tax return unless he has contributed to the trust or has received any distribution from the trust during the year unfortunately while one may arrive at this conclusion on an interpretation no clarification has been issued in the faqs to that effect similarly whether unvested stock options amount to assets is not clear and has not been clarified there is also a lack of clarity as to the date on which the foreign assets should have been in existence to be eligible for making the declaration the valuation rules refer to the valuation as of  july  being taken for the purposes of the declaration from the provisions of the act it however appears that the assets in existence on or before  april  are to be declared there appears to be a mismatch between the two dates the valuation rules also require in case of an undisclosed foreign bank account that all the credits in the account from the date of opening of the bank account be disclosed in the declaration however there may be certain deposits in that foreign bank account where the source is income which has been taxed or which is not in the nature of income taxable in india for instance a loan taken from a bank under the provisions of the act if bank deposits represent items that are not income chargeable to tax in india such deposit would not be an undisclosed foreign asset this is however in contradiction to the valuation rules the faqs do not throw any light on this either a large number of taxpayers may also not be able to declare their undisclosed overseas bank accounts because of the valuation rule that requires all credits to the bank account since its opening to be declared as the value of the bank account most overseas banks would provide bank statements only of the past  years to customers and in the absence of complete bank statements it would invite certain prosecution and penalty for the remaining period for which statements are not available given the fact that the act does not require disposal of the foreign asset and repatriation of the proceeds back to india a person who declares foreign assets would need an assurance that separate proceedings under the foreign exchange management act fema are not initiated against him on declaring such foreign assets while there are provisions that the declaration cannot be used as evidence for penalty or prosecution under fema these may not suffice the taxpayer would be required to continue to show such foreign asset in his return of income in subsequent years and such disclosure could become the basis of action under fema against the taxpayer a clarification is therefore required to the effect that no action would be taken under fema in respect of such undisclosed asset which is declared under the act even a small oversight or clerical error whereby a foreign asset is declared in earlier years income tax returns but due to a mistake remains to be disclosed in a subsequent years tax return could invite the penalty and imprisonment for such nondisclosure taxpayers would have to take extreme care to ensure that every foreign asset is properly disclosed in every years return without fail there have been problems in the past with the income tax return utility for  filing not permitting certain types of data to be entered can a taxpayer be penalized under this act if he is not able to enter the data properly due to improper tax return utility does the government have the mechanism in place to ensure that problems faced by taxpayers due to such mistakes or defects are rectified at the earliest so that they are not penalized under this act the finance minister had announced that there would be safeguards to ensure that the provisions of this act would not be used to harass honest taxpayers but no such instructions have been issued till now which could be in the nature of safeguards given the severity of the penal provisions it is also absolutely essential that clarifications be provided on aspects where there is ambiguity such a law cannot be drafted ambiguously  a tax law and left to the courts to interpret it has to be  a criminal law with clarity on what constitutes an offence it is only then that the act would serve the purpose of only targeting dishonest taxpayers and keep honest taxpayers away from

about the new rs  notes sep    ist bjp black money black money bill congress cpi cpm ncp by dinesh unnikrishnan the handling of black money amassed by indians both in india and abroad has taken the central stage ever since the narendra modi government assumed power at the centre something which the upa government too promised and failed before a window offered by the nda government to blackmoney hoarders to come clean on their doings expires on  september there is no clarity yet how successful the scheme has been the larger point here is that it is even more critical now to address the issue of nontransparent financial transactions of political parities so that politicians can claim the credibility and integrity to point fingers at the wrongdoers involved in illegal transactions as of now the political parties questioning black money including the ruling bjp cannot claim the credibility to point fingers at those with illgotten wealth since many of their own financial transactions are dubious in nature to do an analysis lets take a look at the  september report released by association of democratic reforms adr which collates data on political funding the report throws some interesting insights there is a notable difference in the declarations made by political parties and their mps on the lumpsum amounts granted and received as part of election expenditure during the lok sabha elections in  the analysis is made based on the expenditure reports submitted by the parties and the mps from the date of announcement of elections to the date of completion of elections out of  mps from national parties a total of rs  crore was declared by  mps as received from their parties whereas the national parties have declared that rs  crores was given to only  mps how would one explain this difference who gave the nondeclared sum by political parties to the politicians the report for instance cites that one mp from the bjp mala rajya laxmi shah had declared that she had received no lumpsum amount from her party whereas her party bjp itself declared that a total of rs  lakhs was given to her for lok sabha elections where did the money go on the other hand a total of rs  crores were declared as received by  mps  mps from the bjp  from the congress five from the cpim and one each from the ncp and cpi but their names are missing from the list of candidates to whom lumpsum amount was given by their parties representational image afp out of  mps to whom the bjp said it had given some lump sum amount only  declared the same amount while  declared an amount larger than what the party said it had given according to the commissions guidelines any lump sum amounts to their candidates should do so through crossed account payee cheque or draft or through bank account transfer and not in cash one should presume that such mismatches are the result of mps not following the election commission rules on money transactions mysterious funding sources financial transactions between parties and their mps in the name of election is just one side of the entire problem the funding sources are still largely a mystery details of the donors such as their names companies address and the individual contribution are unavailable for public scrutiny hence a format similar to the donations report submitted to the eci election commission of india on an annual basis has to be prescribed so as to bring in more transparency in the functioning of the political parties especially during elections the adr report said at present  percent of the source of the funds to political parties is unknown remember india is probably among the very few countries where political funding is not transparent in most other countries bhutan nepal germany france italy brazil bulgaria the us and japan the complete details of the donors to political parties are publicly available according to an earlier adr report for the period  a total of rs  crores  percent was declared as donations by the bjp from donors whose addresses were not declared such contributions were made through  donations without providing the details of addresses of the donors due to lack of complete information about the donors the state from which the donations were made and the details of their  houses could not be verified as per the  report the bjp received total donations of rs  crore in that year the congress received rs  crore the ncp rs  crore the cpi about rs  crore and the cpm rs  core there is ambiguity in cash donations from  donors declared by the bjp which amounted to rs  lakhs in fiscal year  the party has not included any remarks though it is part of the prescribed format of the eci thus there is a need for clarity in large amounts of cash donations by individuals  houses the report had said the amounts mentioned in these reports are nowhere near the amount of black money rumoured to have stashed in foreign and domestic soils but the question is about what one preaches and what he practices when the very fundamentals of the questioning authority are flawed how can the same party question the illgotten wealth of others it is even more critical

the window was closed on september   taking advantage of the compliance window  declarants declared assets and income of rs  crore in total this meant that the government will be able to collect around rs  crore  of rs  crore as tax revenues this means around rs  crore of tax and penalty will be collected on an average from every declarant for all the hype and hoopla that has happened around black money in the last one year this is barely peanuts the tax and the penalty need to be paid to the government by december   the annual report of the ministry of finance for  has some interesting data points that need to be mentioned here the total number of assesses in  had stood at  crores these include individuals families trusts and corporates what this clearly tells us is that not many indians pay income tax hence as a result every year a significant amount of black money on which tax is not paid is generated and given this a collection of rs  crore is basically a bad joke especially once you take into account the tremendous amount of political capital that the narendra modi government are spending on the black money issue having said that this should hardly come as a surprise to the government given that the black money recovery skills of the income tax department are nothing to write home about as the ministry of finance annual report points out the income tax offices throughout the country continued their drive against tax evaders during the financial year  up to   provisional search warrants were executed leading to the seizure of assets worth rs  crore provisional during the financial year up to   surveys provisional were conducted which yielded a disclosure of undisclosed income of rs  crore provisional so once rs  crore is looked at from the point of the numbers mentioned in the above paragraph it does not look so dreadful the basic point here is that the black money recovery skill of the income tax department has been very poor there could be several reasons for this corruption incompetence not enough people or simply the fact that the crooks are always one step ahead of those who are supposed to catch them long story shortpeople who have a large amount of black money know fully well the competence level of the income tax department and their ability to recover black money from those who have it once we take this factor into account finance minister arun jaitleys  that those who declared their black money to the government could sleep well can be categorised as an empty rhetoric and nothing more in fact after the flopshow jaitley seems to have discovered that the bulk of the black money is within india the bulk of black money is still within india he wrote on his  page i have been saying this on various media platforms over the last few months a lot of this domestic black money has made its way into real estate over the years as a report on black money brought out by the  lobby ficci in february  points out the real estate sector in india constitutes for about  of the gdp of indian economy as these transactions involve high transaction value in the year  real estate sector has been considered as the highest parking space for the black money what has this government or any other for that matter done to target the black money that has made its way into the real estate sector absolutely nothing in fact the surprising thing is that sector continues to operate more or less without any regulator despite constituting  of the indian gdp a simple explanation for this is the fact that bulk of the illgotten wealth of politicians is in the real estate sector and no government wants to disturb the statusquo a recent report in the economic times points out that doctors engineers and former senior managers who used to work overseas these professionals formed the biggest chunk of those who made use of the day grace period for the declaration of unaccounted wealth politicians did not come out of the closet to declare their black money and politicians as i pointed out earlier have their blackmoney in real estate black money has also made its way into the stock market through the anonymous pnote route pnotes are derivative instruments issued by foreign institutional investors fiis to investors to invest in the stock market as well as the debt market without registering with the regulator ie the securities and exchange board of india what this means is that fiis issue pnotes to investors whose identities are not known to the indian regulator now compare this to the kyc that any indian has to carry out in order to invest in a mutual fund open a bank account or get a credit card the  is definitely not a fair place the investments coming into india through the pnote route were at rs  lakh crore as on february  a major portion of this money came in through cayman islands mauritius and bermuda as a recent report in  today magazine points out cayman island with a population of less than  routed investment worth rs  crore hence pnotes are possibly being used to reroute black money generated in india into the indian stock as well as debt market the last time government tried banning pnotes in  the decision did not go down well with the fiis the government had to withdraw the ban having said that as the  today report points out since  the market regulator tightened the noose and their  in fii investments came down from  per cent in  to  per cent in february  nevertheless even  is a big number the question is will the government ban pnotes the answer is no the stock markets are anyway edgy these days and the government needs to raise rs  crore during the course of this year and for that it needs a strong stock market over and above this there are operators running black ka white schemes as well points out columnist debashis basu in a recent column in the  standard basu writes that not much has been done on this front either to conclude people in decisionmaking

levying a  per cent tax and  per cent penalty on this money the total revenue collected from this effort would be rs  crore this is not even a drop in the ocean of black money in response to this finance minister arun jaitley wrote on his  page the bulk of black money is still within india we thus need a change in national attitude where plastic currency becomes the norm and cash an exception the government has been working to incentivise this change the opening of a large number of payment gateways internet banking payment banks and the emerging reality of ecommerce will prompt the use of plastic money significantly with the rise of plastic money the hope is that the total amount of black money generated in the indian financial system will go down with plastic money it is fairly easy to keep track of transactions and hence tax them while this may or may not happen there is a simple thing that mr jaitley and the modi government can do to kickstart their war against domestic black money it should be made compulsory for political parties to receive donations only through the plastic money route and as cheques given that it is so passionate about unveiling black money in the country the bjp can take a lead on this and start taking donations only through the plastic money and cheque route one bogey that can be raised against this suggestion is about those who do not have a bank account how will they donate money to a political party if they want to the ministry of finance in a press release dated september   had said the achievement under pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana pmjdy is heading towards saturation initial demand for bank accounts was expected to be around  crore  million however so far close to  crore accounts have been opened  crore rupay debit cards have been issued if these numbers are to be believed then most indians now have access to a formal banking channel they also have debit cards and these can be used to make donations to political parties while everyone who has a debit card may not know how to use them currently it can be easily taught prime minister modi has communicated extensively on asking people to give up their subsidised cooking gas he can do the same with rupay debit cards the government can run ad campaigns on it as well once donations made to political parties move away from cash there will be an audit trail no black money will go into the funding of parties breaking the nexus between politicians and those who have black money once black money stops funding political parties the government the present government and the ones to come is bound to crack down on domestic black money until then they will only make statements because there is no incentive to crack down on black money also political parties should be brought under the ambit of the rti act the government is against this move in an affidavit submitted to the supreme court in late august  the modi government had said if political parties are held to be public authorities under rti act it would hamper their smooth internal working which is not the objective of the rti act and was not envisaged by parliament further it is apprehended that political rivals might file rti applications with malicious intentions adversely affecting their political functioning i guess the only reason the government is opposing political parties being brought under rti is because then people can file an rti and be able to get the funding details of political parties and that is something no political party is comfortable with at the state level real estate companies are big financiers of political parties real estate is where most black money gets invested once political parties are brought under rti this nexus can start to unravel as well the nation

adr bjp black money congress connectthedots cpi cpm electoral reform political funding by dinesh unnikrishnan yet again the lack of transparency in political funding has taken the centre stage with both the bhartiya janata party bjp and aam aadmi party aap actively engaging in mudslinging questioning the means their rivals raise funds to sustain their respective political establishments especially for the bjp which has declared a crusade against black money holders seeking asylum in foreign tax havens it is supremely critical to clear its position back home first on the ways it solicits funds flow into its own kitty but so are for the congress and other political outfits too the lack of transparency kills the right and locus standi of political party to question the wrongdoers involving black money holders tax evaders or for that matter any financial misappropriation involving public money representational image reuters that is probably the situation most of our leading political parties find themselves in and the problem runs deeper and widespread if one goes by the latest report of the association for democratic reforms adr and national election watch for  that analyses the details of political funding received by various political outfits there is a lot of explaining most of the leading parties including the bjp has to do at present about  percent of the sources of funds to political parties remain unknown this is in stark contrast to the situation in several countries such as bhutan nepal germany france italy brazil bulgaria us and japan where the complete details of the donors to political parties are publicly available going by the report the bjp hasnt yet submitted its donations report to the election commission for  while the congress has not provided pan details of donors without which it would be difficult to link the donors against their donations and hence trace the money trail these words would sound similar to the ones often used in the black money probe even though the stated donations of political parties are just a minuscule when compared to the circulated blackmoney numbers but more than the size of funds perhaps the practice should be questioned since it concerns public representatives now take a closer look as per the  report the total amount of donations above rs  declared by the national parties was rs  crores from  donations the congress received rs  crore ncp rs  crore cpi about rs  crore and cpm rs  core interestingly the bsp declared that the party did not receive any donations at all above rs  during  as it has declared in the past as mentioned earlier the bjp hasnt submitted the donation report to be sure the adr report for  doesnt give the total income details of political parties but just donations which forms only a fraction of the total income the remaining came from other channels such as sale of coupons and voluntary donations in the form of cash donations where the identity of the donor is difficult to establish for taxmen but according to its previous reports the total income of national parties between  and  stood at rs  crores these numbers exclude funding of regional parties these figures only include the declared income which typically constitute less than a quarter of the total income of the outfit of the total declared income of national political parties in  rs  crore declared donations formed only a fraction  of the total income there is high probability that significant chunk of cash mobilised by indian political parties for election funding and other expenditure are black money transactions that take place right under the nose of the government central bank taxmen and a myriad of investigative agencies a lot of cash donations received remain unaccounted for in the books of accounts as only those amounts would be recorded for which a receipt has been issued warns the previous round of adr report given that unearthing black money is one of the major poll promises in narendra modis election agenda he shouldnt be silent about lack of transparency in political funding remember modi himself emerged victorious in the recent election riding a massively funded campaign but to be sure there is no logic in questioning one politician alone as most of them are complicit their silence on lack of transparency in political funding is probably linked to the very question of their existence itself in  the congress declared the highest total income of rs  crore followed by the bjp with rs  crore and the bsp with a declared total income of rs  crore the ncp had a total income of rs  crore cpi rs  crore and cpm rs  crore in  corporates topped the list of contributions with  percent to the national parties followed by individual donations with  on the other hand in  corporate contribution to total donations rose to  percent of total while those fro individuals stood at  percent in  about  percent of donors to the national parties have not declared their pan details in the contribution form interestingly the bjp has listed the maximum number of donors who have not declared their pan details how much money has changed hands from corporate and wealthy individuals to politicians in  a total of rs  crores was declared by inc cpi and cpm as amounts received by chequedd without disclosing corresponding chequedd numbers name of the bank branch on which the cheque was drawn etc which would aid in tracking the donations these incomplete details account for  of the total donations received in chequedd fund transfer adr report said according to section c of the representation of people act  the political parties have to submit their contribution details received in excess of rs  from any person or a company to the election commission of india annually according to adr report named contributions ie single contributions above rs  were found to be very few in number for all the parties when compared with their total income raising serious questions about the source of the significant part of their funding beyond the technicalities the basic point here is that given the experience of rampant corruption across sectors involving politicians and corporations the funds flowing into political coffers every penny of it by all political parties should be brought under the right of public to scrutinize it would be particularly difficult for the ruling government to convince the common man about its willingness to fight blackmoney before cleaning up its own house such an exercise besides increasing the credibility of political establishments would also help to expose the infamous nexus between corporations politicians and banks that has given rise to a huge amount of bad loans in indias banking system the last time the government made any change in the election funding rules was in  when it allowed corporations and individuals to seek income tax exemption on donations made to political parties of rs  or more in a year any significant change that relates to the political funding should happen through appropriate legislation the big question is whether modi has the political will to exorcise corruption and black money from the political establishments including his own first published on feb    ist india vs england jayant yadav is a natural fit in virat kohlis scheme of things

and other institutions with nearly  tonnes added every year the intention of the scheme is to monetise this gold the scheme intends to replace the  gold deposit scheme and gold metal loan scheme which had failed to win traction with consumers in order to give it mass appeal the government has drastically cut the minimum quantity of gold that a customer can deposit from  gm or half a kilo in the earlier scheme to a mere  gm the new model will also continue with earlier schemes triple tax exemptions capital gains tax wealth tax and income tax not only is the scheme attractive to retailers who will earn back the principal and interest in the form of gold or cash as they choose but banks have also been incentivised and encouraged to take gold as deposits banks are allowed to fix their own interest rates on these deposits and the gold mobilised through this scheme can be used to meet the crrslr requirements this has been a longstanding demand by banks since they are not able to monetise their gold deposits by allowing banks to use gold for crrslr government has indirectly fixed a ceiling to the interest rate that the banks will be willing to offer but banks will be able to free cash from the crr which was not yielding any returns further banks will be permitted to sell the gold to generate forex reserves proceeds of which can be used for trade finance in short gold locked in banking system will start contributing to the economy broking firm nomura feels that even if the scheme is able to create only  tonnes in gold deposits every year over the next few years it could help reduce gold import bill by  per cent saving  billion of foreign reserves every year however one key area of concern is whether the scheme will be used for converting black money into gold the draft is silent on verification of the gold holdings one of the oldest forms of conversion of black money has been as gold streedhan money that a woman bringsobtains as gift during her marriage and ancestral undisclosed routes can be used to convert black money by using this scheme such money will enter in the system without being penalised the only relief is that it will start contributing to the economy though the minimum level amount of gold that can be deposited has been reduced government will have to spell out the maximum that is acceptable without any questions being asked though banks will be following the knowyourclients kyc norms clarity will be needed from the government if there are going to be any linkage between amount of gold deposited and known sources of income barring this one issue of source though the scheme is a step in the right direction nomura sums up the gold monetisation scheme well by saying it as an interesting concept for india that could increase the recycling of domestic fold monetise some physical savings and to some extent also reduce the dependence on gold import copyrights ©   standard private ltd all rights reserved upgrade to premium services

companies with same address same contact numbers use of only mobile numbers sudden and unexpected change in turnover declared in returns etc parts of sits third report was released by the government a day after hsbc holdings plc whistleblower herve falciani claimed a lot of information on illicit funds is lying unused by the indian authorities he added that he was willing to cooperate with the

such beneficial interest and ownership as provided for in the companies act  it pointed out that there are  individuals holding directorships in more than  companies in violation of section  of the

 according to data compiled by the ministry of corporate affairs sit also observed that the suppression of receipts and inflation of expenditure through bogus invoices was a means of generating black

and thereby launder large sums of money at minuscule commissions sit said due to frequent migration such entry operators escape prosecution under the income tax act the appellate tax bodies also tend to tax their income at nominal rates there is no effective deterrence except for taxing commission on such bogus receipts and tax in the hands of beneficiaries providing fake bills and entries need to

authorities in the country b which would automatically forward the details to authorities in country a to help them examine the data once in place the mechanism would help the indian authorities to

after meeting his swiss counterpart eveline widmerschlumpf in davos last month jaitley said the bilateral agreements with regard to automatic exchange of tax information with various countries including switzerland would be the long term solution to check this menace as it steps up measures to bring back black money stashed overseas current law allows the government to reopen tax assessment for cases as old as  years with respect to taxing the unaccounted money overseas experts said the challenge for the indian tax authorities would be in building a strong case experts opined that the time limit of  years provides adequate time to the tax authorities to bring to tax income in relation to assets located outside the country grant thornton advisory pvt ltds director pallavi bakhru said that first tax authorities would have to build a case that the money lying in offshore bank accounts in unaccounted and tax liability on such income has escaped assessment this exercise would need to be completed for tax authorities to form an opinion that certain income has escaped assessment which would be needed to issue a notice for reassessment she said kpmg in indias partner tax vikas vasal said the challenge in case of overseas income or assets situated outside india is in getting necessary information and also to collaborate it with sufficient evidence for having a strong case therefore the relevant provisions in the treaty or the specific information exchange agreements play an important role in this context in general roving enquiries are not permitted and information has to be sought for a particular case or a transaction from the overseas authorities he noted about loopholes in existing tax law regime that may hurt efforts to recover untaxed money bakhru said there is a lack of structured mechanism to recover taxes from foreign assets of nonresident taxpayers besides litigation options are available to taxpayers challenging the tax assessment and consequent tax demands can come in way of governments effort to recover taxes from unaccounted money bakhru said after last weeks fresh hsbc list expose wherein names of  indians have been

partner ey capital expertise tax as promised with the objective to deal with the menace of black money stashed away abroad the government of india has come up with some measures and an institutional move in this direction is enacting the black money undisclosed foreign income and assets and imposition of tax act  the black money act this law has come into force from  july  and will be applicable to individuals qualifying as resident and ordinarily residents ror of india intriguingly india is neither the first nor is it the only country to create a specific law to track income abroad it follows in the footsteps of the landmark foreign account tax compliance act fatca brought into force by usa whilst certain countries have no exact equivalent in tax legislation but uk for instance has several different anti avoidance laws including a disclosure regime for any tax avoidance schemes and a wider law to prevent money laundering such as the proceeds of crime act india has also joined the multilateral competent authority agreement mcaa on  june  in support of its various tax transparency initiatives including automatic exchange of information aeoi aeoi results in sharing of information without making a specific request for it it also helps to facilitate sharing of bulk tax payer information in a systematic and periodic manner amongst various jurisdictions which have joined this agreement the black money act has stringent provisions in the form of a  tax and a penalty amounting to three times the tax along with prosecution proceedings which can extend upto ten years it also specifies that no exemption deduction set off or carry forward of losses which the indian tax laws ordinarily permit in the calculation of taxes shall be allowed this law also offers a one time compliance window for a limited period as an opportunity for the taxpayers to voluntarily disclose overseas undisclosed assets which are acquired from the income which was taxable in india for any year prior to  but not offered to tax in india under the onetime compliance window the taxpayer will pay tax at  in addition to a penalty of  of such tax the taxpayers availing benefit of the one time compliance window will be granted immunity from prosecution under this law and under the income tax act  foreign exchange management act  wealth tax act  companies act  and customs act  however the compliance scheme will not be applicable for taxpayers whose tax assessments tax proceedings are initiatedpending finalization under the indian tax laws or where any information on the undisclosed assets has been received by the competent authorities on or before  june  under the agreements entered by the indian government or for taxpayers on whom any proceedings prosecutionoffences under the indian laws are pending as the compliance window is now notified the taxpayer will need to furnish a declaration of undisclosed overseas assets to the tax authority by  september  subsequently taxes and penalty have to be paid by  december  and acknowledgement of acceptance is to be provided within  days of taxpayers intimation of payment of tax and penalty it is clearly set out in the black money act that the undisclosed assets shall be taxed at fair market value accordingly the rules have been prescribed for the valuation of undisclosed assets for example value of immovable propertybullionjewellery has been defined as higher of cost market value and value given by a registered valuer recognized by the government of the specified jurisdiction similarly value of bank account has been defined as sum of all deposits since date of opening of such undisclosed account fmv shall be first determined in the currencies as permitted by the reserve bank of india rbi and the same shall be converted into local currency as per reference rate provided by rbi as on the valuation date the cbdt has also provided clarifications in respect to the issues that are open to different interpretations in its recent circular dated  july  the one time compliance window that has been set up follows the principle of natural justice by providing an opportunity to the taxpayers to come out clean before stringent actions are initiated against them taxpayers who desire to avail the facility will need to act fast as the compliance requirements apart from being time sensitive involve collation of old records of various assets apart from assets such as  bank accounts and so on individually working in and outside india will also need to evaluate disclosure requirements of pension endowment social security and similar plans overseas this will be based on a careful evaluation of the plan to understand the vesting rights in the plan conditions for withdrawal and so on it should be noted that misrepresentation or suppression of facts or information will make the declaration void and will expose taxpayers to stringent consequences of penalty and prosecution under the black money act further tax and penalty paid will also be forfeited in such cases author is tax partner with ey digvishesh pahwa senior tax professional ey contributed to the article views expressed

of bringing black money stashed abroad by indian citizens abroad however the real fight is between jethmalani and finance minister arun jaitley who is also a leading light of the supreme court bar both were law ministers under atal bihari vajpayee and had locked horns both in the cabinet and in the courts jethmalani who was once the treasurer of the bharatiya janata party has trained his guns on jaitley for not doing enough to bring back the unaccounted money sent out through hawala route but jaitley robustly defends the actions of the government arguing that it has to go through the legal route to force offenders to reveal the foreign accounts maintained before the general elections jethmalani had convinced the then prime ministerial candidate modi and then bjp president rajnath singh that only political will was needed to bring back the billions of rupees stashed abroad the bjp had even said if all the money was recovered each indian would get rs  lakhs and that the recovered black money could substantially reduce indias foreign debt modis staunch supporter baba ramdev too had launched a national campaign on similar lines they had all criticised the upa government and manmohan singh of not doing enough to bring back the countrys money the first decision of the modi cabinet was to form a special task force headed by a retired supreme court lawyer to suggest specific ways to tackle the scourge of the economic system the government also passed a law which made it mandatory for indian citizens to declare details of their foreign assets and funds under the pain of imprisonment and heavy fines september  was the deadline the income tax department recently announced that the window kept open for undisclosed funds had  declarations disclosing rs  crores as undeclared income under the new black money law about  per cent of this money would be recovered as income tax and penalty the cbi had told the supreme court once that a guesstimate had put the black money abroad as over rs  lakh crores however jethmalani had put it at rs  lakh crores however jailtey has said he was taking measures to prevent generation of black money by insisting on bank transactions in areas prone for black money generation such as real estate  transfers gold and silver purchase and award of government contracts he also insisted that modis war against black money is part of an agenda of the g grouping of the worlds largest economies and that he was promised by  leaders such as american president barack obama german chancellor angela merkel and british prime minister david cameron among others for cooperation in preventing the flow of indian black money into their countries jaitley has also directed income tax department to identify hawala dealers and

jethmalani the prime minister has repeatedly said that he does not bow down to anybodys pressure while governing the country and has given examples of how auctions for coal telecom and radio spectrum were done in the most transparent manner tailpiece the department of personnel has reminded ministries to send the list of posts for which appointments can be made without interviews the department is

budget speech by rajesh pandathil finance minister arun jaitleys proposals on gold in his first fullyear budget are likely to to become counterproductive because of his reluctance to remove the higher import duty imposed on the yellow metal experts have said in his bid to make domestic gold attractive and by that way reduce imports the finance minister has proposed three steps in the budget he announced launching of a gold monetisation scheme to replace both gold deposit and gold metal loan schemes a financial asset sovereign gold bond as an alternative to buying physical gold and also a india gold coin which is expected to reduce demand for coins minted outside india and also help recycle the holdings available in the country indian households are estimated to be possessing  tonnes of gold reuters the minister however did not reduce the high import duty of  percent imposed on gold by the erstwhile united progressive alliance government in order to rein in the widening current account deficit due to increased out flow dollar to  gold from overseas the jwellery sector had been seeking a cut in the import duty which will increase the supply of gold and also curb illegal imports though the high import duty brought down imports it has pushed up smuggling according to  gold council as much as  tonnes of gold were brought into the country through illegal routes in  india legally imports about  tonnes of gold every year and so the steps announced are not enthusing the the sector players the fm has announced a slew of measures to curb black money in india yet he has ignored one of the biggest issues of smuggling of gold into the country unless the import duty is lowered the unofficial route will thrive and even black money may find a way into the country in the form of gold mehul choksi chairman of gitanjali group has been quoted as saying in a report in the economic times gold along with real estate has always been an asset where unaccounted money is parked traders however have told the newspaper that if the finance ministers gold monetisation scheme is attractive it can bring down smuggling another impact of the finance ministers hesitance to remove the restriction is a likely surge in gold imports in the next few months this is because jwellers and traders have put buying of gold on the hold in the runup to the budget hoping the government will reduce the import duty but with the status quo in order to meet their pent up demand they will have to go on a buying spree imports will pick up in march because in the past one month there wasnt much imports everyone was waiting for the duty changes rajesh mehta chairman of rajesh exports has been quoted as saying in a bloomberg report he expects the imports to be  tonnes this month as against just  tonnes in february the reasons for the demand surge for gold during the upa was twofold the high inflation which typically increases the appetite for the metal as it is seen as a hedge against the price rise and the rising prices of gold which made it more attractive than any other financial assets so curbing the imports through import duty hikes was no solution as such restrictions will only increase illegal trades in contrast the nda has been lucky as inflation is trending downwards and overseas gold prices are also falling the time is right for jaitley to at least started reducing

stocks listed on indian exchanges however all investors whether institutions or individuals were required to register themselves with the capital markets regulator sebi to get around these restrictions fiis started to issue socalled participatory notes or pns to investors who for various reasons wanted to remain anonymous pns were essentially overseas derivative instruments or odis that had indian stocks or derivatives as their underlying securities with the holder entitled to the income or capital appreciation from such investment the practice was sort of legitimised during the tenure of d r mehta as sebi chairman after a high level committee on capital markets in  allowed subaccounts of fiis to issue such contracts since pns tracked the value of indian stocks their values rose or fell according to the movement of the markets initially nobody complained as fiis generated a lot of  from monies routed through them and their accounts these monies fuelled the market boom

were from overseas jurisdictions such as the cayman islands a tax haven that accounted for  per cent of all foreign inflows from offshore derivative instruments the worry is on account of the fact that the outstanding value of pns at the end of february  was  lakh crore which if unwound can lead to carnage in a market where local institutional investors are not as influential finance minister

indian regulators or taxmen and over indications that wealthy indians including promoters of indian companies have been using this route to bring back unaccounted funds and to rig their stocks the concerns were first flagged by the joint parliamentary committee on the  securities market scam which said that pnotes enabled their holders to conceal their identities the committee also pointed to the links that stock market player ketan parekh had with foreign entities which allowed him to allegedly rig stocks and to the role of overseas corporate bodies or ocbs owned predominantly by indians in the stock market crash the jpc wanted action on these issues what followup action was taken within weeks of taking over as rbi governor y v reddy used the jpc recommendations to ban on september

left an enduring impact apparently the rbi was then given to understand that sebi led at the time by g n bajpai would take steps to ban pnotes the sebi board approved it but for reasons that remain unclear the ball was passed to the nda government led by atal bihari vajpayee which sat on it subsequently as foreign fund flows started accelerating the central bank again sought a ban on pnotes pointing to the lack of regulation and the difficulty in identifying the nature of beneficial ownership the problems with the investments multilayered nature were subsequently brought out in investigations by sebi and the tax authorities the other worry was of course the volatile nature of such flows which impacts the rupee financial stability and the larger economy and leaves indian markets vulnerable to shortterm fund flows what has sebi done so far to regulate pnotes in  sebi tightened rules to ensure pns were issued and transferred only to regulated entities on october   against the backdrop of a surge in capital flows and excess liquidity the regulator banned pnotes m damodaran was sebi chief then and p chidambaram was finance minister the markets crashed immediately but recovered after the regulator unveiled rules a week later saying fiis could not take any fresh exposure and their existing investments would have to be wound up in  months but exactly a year later during the tenure of damodarans successor c b bhave all restrictions on pns were removed in the wake of the global financial crisis amid fears of capital outflows but rules were tightened again subsequently from january  fiis have had to provide an undertaking that they have followed kyc norms and submit details of transactions in  new rules on foreign portfolio investors made it mandatory for those issuing pns to submit a monthly report disclosing their portfolios after which the number of entities issuing these has come down allowing overseas individual investors entry in  also helped change the environment why is it difficult to ban pnotes the rbi may be pushing hard but the government which has the final say in foreign investment rules appears to be reluctant to impose a full ban presumably because of a fear that the stock markets would tank and there would be a flight of capital with fiis now controlling  per cent of the free float in listed indian companies policymakers would want to think several times especially in a country which runs a current account deficit and needs foreign investment to bridge the gap in savings during the upa governments tenure a committee headed by the then chief economic advisor ashok lahiri released a report in november  on encouraging fii flows and checking the vulnerability of capital markets to speculative flows the committee suggested measures such as greater broadbasing of foreign entities investing in the indian market and a ceiling on fiis and their subaccounts the majority view however was that the existing dispensation for pns ought to continue in a move that was rare for a situation in which a governmentled panel was involved the rbi dissented arguing that pns should not be permitted because it remained difficult to identify their final holders so what policy options are available on pns with more broadbased flows and greater global pressure now on checking illicit fund flows it should be possible to phase out pns over the medium term that is if it is grandfathered or in other words spread out over a specified period with a sunset clause that should go hand in hand with reforms in taxation including greater clarity easier norms lowering of transaction costs and encouraging more local institutional investors especially pension funds and fdi to reduce reliance on volatile flows

much ink has been spilt on the undisclosed foreign income and assets imposition of tax bill unfina in the last few days but most of this is based on the bills sections directives and penalties as cleared by the cabinet the conversations around unfina have been relegated to the number of years of imprisonment fines and percentage of penalties leading to a classic case of missing the woods for the trees in essence the unfina bill provides for separate taxation of undisclosed income in relation to foreign income and assets it is proposed that such income should henceforth not be taxed under the incometax act  but under the provisions of the new legislation combined with defined punitive measures of penalties and imprisonment one has in theory a potent addendum to the growing net of laws and measures against money laundering it is expected that the government may provide a compliance window of three to six months though it is our view that a window of at least nine months should be given for those who may want to use this onetime opportunity to liquidate their assets and bring them back to the country it is also important to note that this is not an amnesty scheme even though differential rates of penalties are being applied it is amply clear that the new law has borrowed in places from the existing incometax act  and hence by that singular measure it is not radically new our politicians and bureaucrats had either the foresight or were faced with black money related issues at the time of enactment of the incometax act in  this shouldnt come as a surprise especially since the first major law targeting black money came into play with the bank secrecy act  usa it is well known that the hawala route of financial transfers was prevalent during medieval times and restricted even by roman law in short this is an old issue which has been recognised and dealt with under modern laws for over  years any new law or directive that seeks to rein in black money should be innovative and radical enough to effect major evolutionary changes unfina seems to take incremental steps at best and widens the regulatory net against black money black money is now prevalent enough in public consciousness for us to discuss the real underlying issues it is usually viewed through the moral prism of good vs evil the truth is that our financial infrastructure convoluted tax policies economic history growth issues terrorism and political requirements are factors in this increasingly complex issue hence black money should be seen under two broad themes of redeemable and infected while the former is black money which has been created out of income or asset on which taxes have not been paid infected black money is related to proceeds of crime ie income generated from nefarious antinational and illegal activities such as drugs human trafficking terrorism corruption etc it is worthwhile to note that the principle behind major aml antimoney laundering compliance norms across the  are aimed at tackling infected black money rather than redeemable black money a close look at the demand and generation of black money will give a better perspective on the prevalence of money laundering activities in india black money is used to fund one of the largest ongoing democratic exercises in the history of mankind ie the indian elections these are the extensive and intensive yearround activity of electing representatives in the lok sabha state assemblies municipal gram zila and block panchayats student bodies and other unions hence any law act or force must look at rectifying this fundamental issue which leads to a moral vacuum and leadership deficit in our fight against money laundering ever since the days of the licence rajwhen there prevailed over  taxation rates and extensive red tapismthe   has found financial solace in keeping a significant portion of their businesses off the books along with simplifying taxation gst other measures reducing the complexities of getting the right approvals and licences singlewindow process the   needs to proactively rectify the taxevasion culture and wean itself off the need for unaccounted profits the list of illegal criminal activities which lead to the generation and usage of black money is fairly lengthy and equally perilous it is these set of issues which will ultimately decide the success or failure of our antimoney laundering laws make no mistake infected black money is generated through these activities and represents clear and present danger hence any law which does not address the root causes of funding of these illegal and nefarious activities is at best window dressing unfina fills a small hole related to income and assets abroad and is an addition to the multiple laws and acts in india aimed at curbing money laundering having said that if the government is genuinely interested in leveraging its power and can somehow coordinate the various government agencies to tackle
